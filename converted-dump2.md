1. Welcome
==========

Welcome to the Community Biology Biosafety Handbook. The handbook is an
open manual that offers biosafety protocols, practices, and
recommendations aimed specifically for the community biology movement.

The goal here is to establish a shared foundation for biosafety and
security practices for the Community Biology labs. We recognize that
while many labs have already developed their practices, other labs are
only now coming online and need not reinvent the wheel.

The entries on this site are meant to serve both older, more
well-established labs, younger labs, and those who are considering
building new lab spaces. For well-established labs, the information here
can serve as a reference or template for updating safety and security
practices. For newer labs or those seeking to build labs, the
information can serve as a foundation for establishing biosafety and
security practices. Our expectation is that you'll adapt the material
you find here and make it your own.

We've tried to make the information accessible, deep, and expansive.
Therefore, we've tried to make the language as clear and as jargon-free
as possible. We've also attempted as best as possible to cover the
breadth of safety practices in community labs. This includes biological,
chemical, and equipment safety, but also subjects unique to community
labs. As such, you'll also find interview practices for screening
potential lab members, considerations when working with children at
festivals, building tips for creating labs in unconventional spaces, and
much more.

We did our best to consider the variety of shapes and sizes of labs.
This handbook includes advice for independent labs, labs housed within
larger makerspaces, and labs within homes and garages. We've also
considered the great variety of activities and projects taking place
within labs.

Creating a Foundation
---------------------

This handbook is designed as a living document that can be updated and
expanded by the community. Because both biotechnology and the Community
Biology movement are rapidly evolving, the information here will need to
be updated periodically. Also, given the variety of labs, the diverse
local and national laws and regulations around labs, and the variety of
interests among lab members, there will always be more that can be
covered.

We chose an open format for the handbook so that members of the
community can edit, update, and expand the contents. It will be the
community's decision on how best to maintain this handbook.

The Authors
-----------

The authors of the handbook are people who have dedicated a significant
portion of their careers to the community lab movement. In many ways,
this has been a dream team of authors. Five of the seven authors have
started or led community labs. One author was president of the American
Biological Safety Association, the leading association of biosafety
officers. Another author has been a policy expert on community biology
for over 10 years.

We would like to acknowledge the time, effort, and energy they put
towards making this handbook a reality. Thank you Angela Armendariz,
Patrik D'haeseleer, David Gillum, Daniel Grushkin, Eric Harness, Todd
Kuiken, and Jenny Molloy.

**2. Laboratory Management Practices**
======================================

Organizational Structure and Safety Officer Roles
-------------------------------------------------

In community biology there is no one standard or "right" way to
structure the organizing team. Structures can depend on your type of
space---whether it's a rented space, kitchen lab, space within a larger
institution, or a mobile lab. Some labs have a hierarchical structure
with a single director, while others have a flat management scheme where
there are multiple directors. What seems to be common and good practice
across organizations is that there is at least one point person who
screens projects for safety (e.g., biological, physical, and chemical)
and a committee of people to assist that point person in making
decisions about safety and security. Often this committee is internal
and allows for multiple people with different areas of expertise to
assess and weigh-in on a proposed project. Some labs have several point
people, where each is devoted to different safety aspects of the
lab---for example, one person might vet chemical safety, while another
vets biological safety. Typically, the safety officer(s) of the lab have
experience working with chemical and/or biological agents in a research
setting, but this is not always the case.

One generally recommended practice is to recruit expert advisors outside
of the organization who you can consult when the safety of a project is
in question or is beyond the expertise of the internal safety point
person or committee. These consultants can be safety officers at
universities, safety committees at other community biology labs, or
colleagues in biotech or university labs who might be an expert in a
field related to a proposed project. Many biosafety professionals are
willing to help provide advice, serve as resources, and volunteer as a
member of a biosafety advisory committee. To find consultants, reach out
to Biosafety Officers (BSOs) at your local universities or connect with
biosafety professionals through the [[American Biological Safety
Association]{.ul}](http://www.absa.org) (ABSA) and [[ABSA regional
affiliates]{.ul}](https://absa.org/affiliates/). You can also ask
biosafety questions on ABSA's [[Biosafety Discussion
List]{.ul}](https://absa.org/email-groups/).

Negotiating a Lab in a Shared Space
-----------------------------------

Often labs are within universities, makerspaces, or share a building
with other businesses or organizations. If the community lab is in a
shared space, it is a good idea to initiate and maintain frequent
communication with other users of the shared space. Consider holding an
open house or inviting neighbors into the space to share experiences and
work progress. Tours and open events could be tied to a local Science
Festival or event to get maximum publicity. Often these can defuse fears
about community labs, make people feel welcome, and help neighbors
understand the value of community labs. If the lab does suffer an
incident, receives bad press, or is attacked by local officials or
interest groups, it can be very valuable to have already built support
within the larger community.

In a shared space, it is also important to be mindful of common spaces.
Lab coats or gloves should not be worn outside the lab. Perception that
you are operating safely is important so it may be useful to clearly
separate and bag trash that looks like it has come from the lab, even
when putting it in the regular waste is permitted by local laws and
biosafety rules. This will help prevent other users of the space from
getting needlessly alarmed by seeing gloves or other lab waste in the
regular bins.

Process for Proposing Projects and Vetting
------------------------------------------

We recommend having in-person conversations with lab members (or
potential members) about project proposals as a first step in collecting
information to address potential safety concerns. Instituting a system
where members can formally submit a written project proposal is an
important next step. Many labs use an online form to submit project
ideas so they may be easily reviewed and approved (see examples of forms
from
[[BioCurious]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScs3u07JuoxYM7v_GgL-LwZIDHw7SYcj6rmFF6RJNy4bCsgxQ/viewform),
[[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/3/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU8xl_6n72gfdUlix6yW5oCHD-K4iUm7L4xboWMD83mUnJ-A/viewform),
or [[iGEM's safety
check]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Safety/Final_Safety_Form)).

In the project form, members are often asked to describe the techniques
they will use, the chemicals and biological agents they will need, and
the amount of time they expect the project to take. Some labs also
inquire about the skill level of the person conducting the research to
determine whether they might need additional knowledge- or skills-based
training or to be matched with a mentor (see [[Biomakespace's project
form]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clan6TTXbopSvlndoP_YEOSCWrX13MRQbKDHSu_rJvU/view)
as an example). It is a good idea to require long-term members to
resubmit project proposal forms when their projects change.

Community labs are founded on the belief that experience should not be a
barrier to lab access. However, it is always a good idea to assess the
experience level of potential members to provide the best possible
support to ensure the safety of everyone working in the lab. Depending
on skill level, restrictions may be established regarding working alone
or operating particular types of equipment until proficiency is gained.
Some labs require or encourage less experienced members to enroll in one
of the skills building courses offered at the lab. Also, it is suggested
to develop approaches for "On the spot" training for resources when
members seem to lack proficiency.

In addition to the project proposal form, some labs ask members to fill
out a Risk Assessment Form that is reviewed by the safety team. The Risk
Assessment Form helps members think through the potential hazards of
their project and to plan mitigation strategies. In some countries, for
example the UK, the regulations for any experiments with genetically
modified organisms require written risk assessments to humans and to the
environment for which "competent advice" (as described in the [[UK
Genetically Modified Organisms Contained Use Regulations
2014]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm)) is obtained
before the experiment can start. Labs such as Biomakespace in the UK,
therefore, also have a
[[form]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vwdneyAZKEMSmvrNdn_cfzS-13smbV_MaK_0nHiNGbc/edit)
that is specific for any GM work that members want to do.

These written forms are good for recordkeeping, lab management, and are
important for keeping detailed information of projects being performed
in labs. They are also good tools for tracking projects in the
long-term. For this reason, we also recommend members update their
proposal documents quarterly or bi-annually as projects change and
develop over time.

Members may be incentivized to maintain and update their proposals
because the information they provide can be helpful in connecting
members with similar interests, assessing lab members' equipment and
reagent needs, deciding on new purchases, avoiding cross contamination,
and preparing grant proposals.

Contracts and Member Agreements
-------------------------------

We strongly recommend that all members be required to sign some form of
legal contract to work in community labs. These membership agreements
typically include all or some of the following:

-   Access and key policies

-   Agreement to abide by safety rules

-   Code of conduct statements

-   Policies about damages caused by members or guests

-   Data policy

-   Description of fees and due dates

-   Different types of membership

-   Eligibility

-   Explanation of benefits---use of the lab and storage space,
    > mentoring, discounts, etc.

-   Guest policy

-   Health risks to immune-compromised members

-   Intellectual property

-   Liability release

-   Lost or abandoned property

-   Membership terms

-   Safe space policy

-   Storage rules

-   Termination rules

-   Value statement (e.g., [[DIY Biology Code of
    > Ethics]{.ul}](https://diybio.org/codes/))

All of these items should be described clearly, in plain language, and
with as much detail as possible. It is a good idea to have the agreement
reviewed by a lawyer. Examples of member agreements are available from
[[Genspace]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaRV-CndEp2pvrnIgqg2bvxOGjwh0tYm/view?usp=sharing),
[[Biomakespace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ko5IVFkdotf9h1xgZsC5UP3K6OkaLQXnE5zEfNyy2cc/edit),
and
[[BioCurious]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRVMkmcjlERmfNm41G6dfSDA8USKBMu-dzRGTKp_ifI/edit?usp=sharing).
\[Please upload your labs examples to provide more resources to the
community.\]

Codes of Conduct 
----------------

Some labs have codes of conduct that are either embedded in the member
agreement or are separate documents. Codes of conduct set expectations
of behavior in the lab and describe actions that will be taken if the
code is violated. Examples are available from
[[BioCurious]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzPDj7v-AYvIZYqI0W8lQerolNGESq64-Br9OXr76u8/edit?usp=sharing)
and
[[Biomakespace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lyi5n9oZt2umtece14ZADq9rba3DKx2FCjTSBFDBiDk/edit).
Another example is the Code of Ethics drawn up by participants of the
2018 [[Global
BioSummit]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swSbo_TidiaL1H-CK_mMW8e_G3cCk-MSw25W9EMdHzY/edit),
further expanded upon in the [[Community Ethics Document
1.0]{.ul}](https://www.biosummit.org/ethics) at the 2019 Global
Biosummit.

Access and Hours
----------------

Many members of community labs are working in the facility in their
spare time, often before or after work hours, or at unusual hours
because of the time-consuming nature of lab experiments. With these
considerations in mind, many labs allow 24 hour, 7 day a week access to
the lab for members. In some labs, this type of open access is given
with the caveat that there always needs to be a second person present
for safety, that the work done after hours be an approved project that
has been vetted, or that members working through the night are required
to notify a safety officer.

It is a good idea to require members to sign in and out of the space
and/or have keys with Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) to allow
labs to track members' comings and goings (or at least entering) when
staff are not on site. Some labs have camera surveillance of their
space. Note that local laws may require posted notification and legal
disclosures for any video surveillance in the facility.

If members are allowed to work in the lab after hours, and to work
alone, there are steps that may be taken to help ensure their safety:

-   Assess the hazards of the lab area to identify existing or potential
    > working alone hazards.

-   Take corrective measures to prevent and minimize hazards or
    > potential incidents.

-   Provide easily accessible emergency equipment, emergency aid, and
    > practical means of obtaining assistance based on the nature and
    > degree of exposure to the hazard.

-   Ensure emergency aid is available and compatible with the member's
    > work.

-   Train members on methods for identification, hazard reduction and
    > prevention when working alone and setting clear action plans for
    > encounters with people who do not belong in the space after hours.

-   Provide an effective form of communication between anyone working
    > alone and the people capable of assisting the individual. Always
    > encourage a buddy system, and ask the member to alert a fellow lab
    > member, partner, or neighbor (even if that person is not in the
    > space) about their whereabouts.

-   Post signage, emergency contact information, and develop a
    > communication system for individuals working alone. These should
    > include a list of phone numbers including the biosafety point
    > person and first responders.

-   Require members to be reachable by cell phone or make a phone
    > service available to members.

-   Ensure that all incidents are reported, investigated, and
    > documented.

Ordering and Receiving Materials
--------------------------------

Monitoring chemicals, reagents, and supplies that come into the
laboratory is crucial for maintaining a safe lab. Community labs manage
this in various ways. When it comes to chemicals and reagents, some labs
require that the lab managers place all of the orders for members, while
others allow members to place their own orders, provided that the items
were pre-approved by the safety officer. For example, at BioCurious,
every chemical must have an owner who is responsible for the chemical,
and their name must be written on it, even if it is a commonly shared
chemical. Owners are responsible for submitting any new chemical
[[Safety Data
Sheets]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html) (SDS)
forms to the safety officers. At Biomakespace, all chemicals were
included in the project proposal and risk assessment, labelled with the
project or user name, and added to the chemical inventory on arrival in
the space. Some states in the U.S. require that inventories be
electronically filed with the state.

Most labs keep lists of all of the chemicals that come into the space
and conduct regular inventories to update the list. This inventory is
important, particularly for emergency responders, such as the fire
department, to know what is in the space. There are some chemical
inventory systems (e.g.,
[[https://www.cheminventory.net/]{.ul}](https://www.cheminventory.net/))
that allow barcodes and labels to be printed and have free tiers up to a
certain number of containers.

Donation of Supplies 
--------------------

**"**Donations" (or dumping) of unwanted reagents, supplies, or
equipment can pose a serious health and safety hazard, put a strain on
limited lab storage space, or impose significant costs for disposal.
Most labs have rules prohibiting members from accepting donations of
chemicals and supplies on behalf of the lab without pre-approval from
the lab manager. This can help prevent potentially hazardous chemicals
from entering the lab and prevent duplicates of equipment that could
pile up. This also helps to keep inventories up to date, which is
important for safety and accounting and ensures that any donation
paperwork reconciles with what is actually on the shelves.

Storage of Member Supplies
--------------------------

Offering members storage space for project supplies can be helpful for
the success of their projects. It is a good idea to specify which
storage locations are considered "inside" or "outside" of the lab area
and what is and is not allowed to be stored in these spaces. Community
labs should avoid the inappropriate storage of hazardous chemicals,
reagents, or equipment. As such, we recommend that labs specify
prohibited chemicals and organisms from being stored in these locations.
Materials should be kept in labeled, clear containers of uniform size to
make it easier to screen things that are being stored.

Easily understood policies need to be established to prevent members
from over encumbering freezer or refrigerator space. Many spaces limit
members to a specific number of boxes or particular size or scope of
storage bins and boxes.

Storage space management policies should be outlined clearly, requiring
labeling and cleanout dates. Frequent cleanouts of storage space should
be communicated and performed on a regular schedule. These messages
should be posted on doors, sent via email, and shared through personal
communication. Membership agreements should also address reagents or
materials that will be discarded or placed in a quarantine bin or box
until disposal and detail how the owner will be contacted and how long
the reagents will remain in the quarantine box (often nicknamed the "box
of shame").

**Example Storage Policies**

**BioCurious:** "We really have designed the lab, architecturally, to be
transparent. Walls are mostly absent, people can see through the space,
almost all storage is required to be transparent, so items are easier to
find and somewhat on display, rather than tucked in drawers or
cabinets."

**Offering to members:** Member bin. We offer members storage for a fee.
To arrange this, email us. Storage needs to be clearly labeled with your
first and last name.

rules]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vx_qm5wYeKRvUAqSQtBf30oYIFagnpQb).

Youth Policies
--------------

For safety and insurance purposes, many community labs do not allow
youth under 18 years of age into their space unless accompanied by an
adult guardian. Check with your insurance provider to confirm their
policy.

Some community biology labs restrict youth under the age of 18 from
working alone in the lab, but allow youth (mostly 14+ years old) to work
or volunteer if supervised by an adult parent or mentor. Some labs
restrict the number of youth that can be supervised by an adult mentor
at one time. Local laws and regulations may also impose limits on how
many minors can be in the space and/or require stricter building codes
and background checks for staff. The NIH has [[this
policy]{.ul}](https://policymanual.nih.gov/3015#97DB16DB) for youth
working in lab space. Those labs that allow youth to have their own
membership, require that they work during regular operating hours, when
staff is onsite. Most labs welcome youth to participate in lab
trainings, courses, and workshops, as long as an adult is participating
with them. Policies should also be outlined for any violation of the
membership agreement policies.

It is good practice to have a safeguarding or child protection policy
(for example, see the
[[Biomakespace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdG2vAGiYsCpx3yk8nmttrL16lS8aExrS3nb3YaTHf8/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103519764889495260290)
policy or the [[Omni Commons Safer Space
policy]{.ul}](https://omnicommons.org/wiki/Safer_Space_Policy)) that
outlines practices that minimize risks of harm from behaviors such as
bullying, harassment or abuse, and a response policy. This is especially
important if minors are not accompanied by adults. This policy may be
linked to a general code of conduct, but we recommend designating a
responsible person to keep up-to-date with best practices specifically
for youth because they are more vulnerable to harm.

In some countries there are regulations around activities and teaching
undertaken with youth under 18 years of age which include requirements
for vetting, criminal records checks, or other requirements.

Note: Laws and insurance requirements will vary about working with
minors depending on where your lab is located. You should check your
local/national laws before starting programs with minors.

Visitor and Guest Policies
--------------------------

If members are permitted to bring guests into the space, it's important
that membership contracts state who is liable for the guests and what
access rights the guests have (e.g., non-lab areas only or lab access
under direct supervision of the host). If member's guests' contact
details will be used to add them to any mailing lists or follow-up with
recruitment information, or if there is an expectation that frequent or
repeat guests become members, it is useful to include this in a written
policy or in the membership agreement so members are aware before they
bring guests to the lab. We recommend creating a sign in and sign out
procedure to keep track of guests who have been in the space (this is
often necessary for fire safety reasons in any case).

We strongly recommend that anyone entering your space (visitors,
volunteers, school groups, etc.) read and sign a liability release
waiver. (For example, these are Genspace's [[general
waiver]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sT3YDZ5jdcrgOn7XwxxthZZrP_KinKDN81ORc_oisfs/edit)
and [[volunteer/intern
waiver]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qywHdaipSDcV3X3Ed8-LrcGRWnRhyQcha_dXGsQXdHQ/edit?usp=sharing)
and BioCurious'a [[general
wavier]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B78d3f_h4TZydmFSU1ZpQWFoS0U)
and [[family membership wavier and
agreement]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tJWKLfxyqQtMZL1Ku2zGDEam4yVGTmb5OSSyIDd0Mow/edit).)
\[Please add your examples here.\]

Insurance and Worker's Compensation
-----------------------------------

**Public liability, general insurance, or umbrella policies:** Given
inherent risks in any lab, we recommend that labs acquire insurance to
cover potential incidents that might cause injury to guests, members,
volunteers, and employees. Without insurance, if someone has been
injured, your organization and potentially you personally may be liable
for the costs. These could easily bankrupt a community lab. Note that
the status of volunteers is ambiguous, but if they have a role
description they are likely to be considered employees for insurance
purposes. Check with your insurer.

**Contents or renters insurance:** We recommend that you insure your lab
and its contents in the event of a fire, theft, or other unforeseen
events. Many landlords require insurance. Please inquire.

**Directors and officers insurance:** Most nonprofit organizations have
this type of insurance to cover their directors for claims made against
them for the management of the organisation. Seek advice about
appropriate coverage from an insurance broker who has experience working
with biotech companies or science centers.

**Events and contractor insurance:** Specific events might require their
own insurance or an insurance rider for use of facilities. We recommend
reviewing insurance that your contractors and service providers hold.
For example, if a service provider damages something in your lab while
trying to repair it, who would be liable? Also create a policy on those
who might use your space for their own purposes. For example, if an
independent instructor uses your space to run their own workshops, do
they have their own public liability insurance or is there an
expectation that you are covering their activities under your own
insurance? Parties that are open to the public and/or serve alcohol may
also require special event permits from the city or police department.

**Other types of insurance:** Make sure to check local regulations for
unusual insurance requirements! In the United Kingdom, and possibly
other countries, labs with autoclaves are required to have special
insurance due to legislation for pressure vessels (UK Pressure Systems
Safety Regulations of 2000, which requires that an autoclave be
inspected by an insurer-approved person every year.)

Working with Startups and Commercial Businesses
-----------------------------------------------

Many community labs open their doors to start-up companies or
individuals pursuing a business. Ensure that the company understands and
is supportive of the mission and goals of the community lab and is held
to the same standards as other members of the lab. These standards
should include openness, transparency and inclusivity (within reason).
Most community labs choose not to claim any ownership of the start-ups
intellectual property (IP) and expect that the same openness is
reciprocated.

Corporate members should be able to provide enough information about
their projects to conduct a safety assessment. Because they are working
in a community lab where open sharing is part of the culture, the
company should be informed that it is responsible for protecting its IP.

Corporate members sometimes ask lab management or other members to sign
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This can expose the lab and its
members to legal risks or responsibilities that may infringe upon the
community lab's culture of openness. In most cases, we recommend that
community labs and their members do not sign NDAs and that this is
written into your policies. If you do choose to sign one, we recommend
seeking legal advice.

Aside from IP and disclosure considerations, startups and commercial
projects will generally use the lab under the same terms as other
members and should be required to sign membership agreements.

Ensure that companies are clear about what they can expect from the
staff (typically volunteers) of the lab. Our experience has been that
some corporate members do not understand the nature of community labs
and expect a professional service---this can be frustrating for both
sides and it's best to manage any misconceptions early on even if
turning down income is difficult.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Despite the challenges of working with companies, these are infrequent
incidents and many community labs have excellent relationships with
their startup members. Company memberships often contribute financially
in ways that can be critical to community lab business models, and they
are important community members in many other ways. They may be more
available in the lab than individual members and willing to assist with
lab management, taking deliveries, publicizing the space within the
startup and investment community, helping pay for new facilities and
servicing of equipment, writing the space into grants, and donating
back. Be mindful and review your policies to maximize the mutual
benefits of working with startups and commercial projects in a way that
all parties feel good.

3. Laboratory Infrastructure and Design
=======================================

Finding a Lab Location and Getting Started
------------------------------------------

Community biology labs come in all shapes and sizes. Whether starting a
lab from scratch or converting a garage or other space, there are some
common infrastructure and design aspects that are important to keep in
mind. First, before thinking about the inside of the lab, consider the
outside and the building that will house the community lab. When
searching for a location, consider the following:

-   **Zoning.** City zoning laws specify how property in specific
    > locations may be used. For example, city officials will define
    > whether a particular area can be residential, commercial, or
    > mixed-use. If the community lab is going to be used as a business,
    > it will need to be located in a zone that allows for commercial
    > use. Zoning may also affect where labs can be located, where
    > externally vented chemical hoods can be used, etc. Contact the
    > local public works office for more information.

-   **Neighborhood.** Consider if the neighbors are biotech friendly
    > ahead of time. Neighbors are an important part of the community
    > and can be advocates for the organization. Get to know them and
    > invite them to tour the facility and participate in educational
    > opportunities. Also, consider who might be uncomfortable with a
    > lab next door, such as restaurants. Make a point of establishing
    > rapport with such businesses.

-   **Access.** Consider whether the location is accessible by public
    > transit and if parking is available. Also, consider local events,
    > such as sporting matches, that may take place in the area.
    > Additionally, consider access for persons with disabilities.
    > Review the [[ADA's Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and
    > Facilities]{.ul}](https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf)
    > for more information.

-   **Safety and security.** Consider the safety of the area,
    > surrounding lighting, and surveillance options if in a high crime
    > area.

-   **Building infrastructure**. Consider whether the building has a
    > sprinkler system, a loading dock, or doors wide enough for large
    > equipment such as a -80°C freezer or a biosafety cabinet to pass
    > through. It is advisable to have more than one exit from the
    > labspace. You'll need an available sink. Another consideration is
    > power---how many electrical outlets are available and what is the
    > maximum load on the main breaker panel? Other considerations
    > include: are there separate rooms you could rent out? Is there a
    > kitchen area that is well-separated from the lab? Is there a large
    > room outside the lab that can be used as a lecture area or
    > classroom?

Environmental and Health Considerations
---------------------------------------

Once a space has been identified or inherited, consider the following
environmental issues:

-   **Potentially contaminated sites.** Before settling on a location,
    > determine past uses of the land and the facility. Determine if
    > hazardous materials still exist on the property. One way to do
    > this in the U.S. is to visit the Environmental Protection Agency's
    > (EPA) website of known [[Superfund
    > Sites]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live)
    > or ToxMap
    > [[http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov]{.ul}](http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov).

-   **Asbestos.** Asbestos is a natural mineral that is known to cause
    > cancer if inhaled. Be aware that flooring tiles, ceiling tiles,
    > pipe wrappings, and insulation may contain asbestos. Visit the
    > U.S. EPA's [[asbestos website]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/asbestos)
    > to learn more about asbestos and to find local vendors who can
    > assist with asbestos remediation.

-   **Radioactivity**. Radioactivity testing should be performed and
    > decontaminated if discovered. Contact a radiation safety company
    > to assess potential radiation contamination.

-   **Mercury.** Mercury can be found in many products, such as
    > thermometers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, barometers,
    > manometers, and other pieces of scientific equipment. Be aware
    > that mercury may be found in sink traps or under floor tiles if
    > the space was ever previously used as a lab or was part of a
    > production facility that used mercury. Visit the EPA's [[mercury
    > website]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/mercury) for more information
    > and to find local vendors that can assist with mercury
    > remediation.

-   **Lead and lead paint**. Lead was banned from U.S. paint products in
    > 1978 but may still be used in other countries. Buildings and
    > structures with lead paint require special precautions, especially
    > if the paint will be removed. You can buy community lead testing
    > kits online or at your local home improvement store. Visit the
    > EPA's [[lead website]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/lead) for more
    > information and to find local vendors that can assist with lead
    > remediation.

-   **Natural disaster zones**. Consider the location of the community
    > facility and whether it will be located in a
    > [[flood]{.ul}](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home), fire hazards,
    > landslide, earthquake liquefaction, or other zone prone to natural
    > disasters. Be aware that some insurance companies will not provide
    > flood insurance to facilities in flood zones. Contact an insurance
    > company to determine if the facility is in a flood zone.

Establishing Contact with Local Agencies
----------------------------------------

We recommend establishing rapport with key personnel at local fire
departments, police precincts, and hospitals, so that if an incident
does occur, first responders and police are familiar with your lab, its
mission, and operations. Establishing such relationships could preempt
misunderstandings about your lab's purpose, aid in the response to an
incident, establish champions of the lab in the community, and help
provide advice in lab safety and security and local ordinances.

After establishing your lab, reach out to your local fire and police
department before any potential incident. Invite them for a tour of the
lab or to a community event to give them a sense of the lab facilities
and activities. A few examples of local agencies to contact include:

-   **Local fire departments.** In some areas, community labs may need a
    > permit from the local fire department. Before building the lab, it
    > is a good idea to contact the local fire department and find out
    > about the local requirements. Typical fire codes set allowances on
    > the amounts of hazardous chemicals in a building and can require
    > additional fire protection (such as fire sprinklers) depending on
    > the local zoning requirements, the materials used in the facility,
    > and the materials used in the construction or renovation of the
    > building. Contacting the fire department early in the process is
    > helpful for identifying these requirements.

-   **Public Health Department.** Inquire with the local Public Health
    > Department to find out about health codes that pertain to labs or
    > if there are reporting requirements in the event of an exposure or
    > accident. In different localities, you may also be required to
    > contact branches dedicated to the management of chemical and
    > regulated medical waste.

-   **Local Chamber of Commerce or neighborhood association.** Some
    > community labs have successfully obtained support from their local
    > chambers of commerce, which has more deeply integrated them into
    > their communities. Consider asking chamber officials to visit your
    > lab and inviting potential funding groups to tour when they visit
    > your city.

-   **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or** **Local Law Enforcement
    > Agencies.** Many community labs have found it beneficial to
    > establish relationships with agents at local FBI offices to
    > identify and address any misconceptions of the nature of the
    > research happening in the lab. For advice on how to reach out to
    > the FBI, contact the heads of community labs in the U.S. (e.g.,
    > Biocurious, Genspace).

Lab Infrastructure and Design
-----------------------------

When setting up a community biology lab, consider the equipment and
materials you will use and the basic infrastructure required to handle
them. Whether setting up a space for the first time, moving to a new
space, or settling into the space, consider the following list of
recommendations for the infrastructure and design of a biology
lab.![](media/image48.png){width="2.308033683289589in"
height="2.308033683289589in"}

-   **Walls and floors.** The lab walls, ceilings, and floors should be
    > smooth, impermeable to liquids and easy to clean. Walls should be
    > fire resistant with no carpet or flammable materials on the wall
    > or barriers. Walls and entryways should separate the lab from
    > non-lab areas. Floors should be slip-resistant, durable, and
    > easily cleaned. Floors should not be carpeted because the fabric
    > may absorb chemicals and dirt and is very difficult to clean.
    > Chemicals that soak into carpet may also cause reactions long
    > after the chemical spill. Carpet may also become a breeding ground
    > for microbes.

-   **Benchtops**. Benchtops should be impermeable to liquids, including
    > disinfectants, and other chemicals such as acids and solvents.
    > Benchtops should be resistant to scratches, impact, and heat. They
    > should not have open seams and should be easy to clean and
    > decontaminate. If your benchtops are wooden, or if only wood
    > benches are available, make sure that they are sealed with an
    > impermeable surface, such as a sealed tile or epoxy coating.
    > Porous materials such as wood veneer products should be avoided as
    > they will absorb chemicals and water and will weaken over time.
    > Wood-grain plastic laminate or phenolic resin may provide an
    > acceptable alternative. Previously used [[stainless steel food

-   **Sink**. A sink for handwashing,dishwashing, and for disposal of
    > non-toxic and non-hazardous liquids should be provided. Sinks
    > should be located near the exit door. If this is not possible,
    > ensure the sink is located as close to the lab as possible. A
    > gooseneck or adjustable faucet and deep pan sink are highly
    > recommended. Many stainless steel sinks from restaurants going out
    > of business are available from auction sales and make wonderful
    > lab sinks. A dish rack for drying glassware that drains into the
    > sink is also helpful. The sink should never be located in an area

    > available, containers of water and hand sanitizer must be
    > available. A portable handwashing station with clean and dirty
    > water containers may be an acceptable solution as long as it is
    > emptied and refilled on a regular basis.

-   **Lab furniture.** Chairs and stools should be non-porous and easily
    > cleaned. Chairs made of vinyl, hard plastic, and hard rubber make
    > good choices. Plastic coverings that can be easily cleaned may be
    > used to cover cloth chairs. Benches and other lab furniture, such
    > as shelving and cabinets, should be of a sturdy design and
    > material to support equipment and storage items. The U.S. National
    > Institutes of Health's (NIH) lab [[Design Requirements Manual
    > (DRM)]{.ul}](https://www.orf.od.nih.gov/PoliciesAndGuidelines/Documents/DRM/DRM1.3032019.pdf)
    > specifies that shelves should be able to hold 50 pounds per linear
    > foot for 1 foot deep shelves. It is recommended that countertops
    > be able to hold no less than 50 pounds per square foot. Shelving
    > with adjustable height shelves are recommended. If located in a
    > seismically active area, restraints and anchorage for shelving and
    > cabinets may be necessary and is often required by local building
    > codes.

-   **Storage space**. Community labs often get their supplies and
    > equipment from donations, auctions, or discount sales. It is
    > important to have adequate storage space for and consider storage
    > requirements for frequently accessed items as well as "deep
    > storage" for less frequently used items. We recommend creating
    > clearly labeled storage spaces inside and outside the lab and
    > discouraging clutter on benchtops or in aisles. Make it easy to
    > see what is stored where: consider using well-labeled and
    > transparent boxes to easily see the contents.

-   **PPE storage space**. Storage space for personal protective
    > equipment (PPE), such as lab coats, gloves, and goggles, should be
    > available throughout the lab. Make sure that any workstation or
    > equipment that requires PPE is labeled with a sign. PPE should be
    > stationed at the lab entrance with signage and available to
    > visitors to the space.

-   **Personal storage space**. Non-lab items such as coats and bags
    > should be stored outside the lab (e.g., on coat racks, hooks,
    > cubbies, closet). Personal or project storage space on shelves and
    > in fridges or freezers is usually allowed at the discretion of lab
    > management. All items should be clearly labeled with the owner\'s
    > name and the contents.

-   **Office space**. Demarcate space for eating, drinking, class, or
    > office work that is outside the lab. Check local zoning
    > requirements to determine if labs and offices must be physically
    > separated.

-   **Lighting.** The lab should have adequate lighting for work at all
    > times during the day. We recommend providing task lighting at the
    > bench or directly by work areas if possible. Reflections and glare
    > should be avoided. Areas containing equipment with ultraviolet
    > (UV) lighting should be limited to those doing work when UV lamps
    > are on, which should only be as necessary. When possible, use a
    > self-timing light switch in rooms that are seldom used as the
    > switches can save a significant amount of money. It is also a good
    > idea to have access to emergency lighting, such as a flashlight,
    > in the case of an electrical outage. Glow-in-the-dark signs can be
    > used to guide lab users to the flashlight and other safety
    > equipment.

-   **Doors.** If possible, doors to the lab should have vision panels,
    > be self-closing, and have the appropriate [[fire
    > rating]{.ul}](https://community.nfpa.org/community/nfpa-today/blog/2018/01/24/101wednesdays-regarding-fire-doors-what-rating-do-i-need).
    > Locking doors with restricted access is important for the
    > prevention of theft, as well as for the physical safety of the lab
    > users. Always ensure that the doors have the proper emergency
    > egress opening direction and are outfitted with panic bars or
    > emergency door release buttons if necessary (check your local fire
    > department). Consider egress routes in the event of an emergency.
    > It is advisable to have two exits from the lab.

-   **Electricity.** Biolabs tend to require greater electrical loads
    > than commercial office spaces. You can estimate the loads you need
    > by adding up the wattage used by individual pieces in the lab. Be
    > sure to tally continuously-on loads (such as fridges and freezers)
    > versus peak loads (such as autoclaves or large centrifuges). You
    > can also do load testing to identify your power needs. All
    > electrical work should be up to code. Make sure the breaker panel
    > is carefully labeled with what circuits or equipment each breaker
    > powers, so they can be safely deactivated in case of emergency. It
    > may be useful to also label each outlet with the number of the
    > breaker that powers it. Check that all power cords are in good
    > condition (especially with older second-hand equipment) and rated
    > for the amperage of the equipment (see [[Chapter 9 - Equipment
    > Usage/Safety]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0)).
    > Many labs start small and grow over time, so it is important to
    > anticipate a higher energy load in the long term. Make sure power
    > is available away from wall sockets. Power drops from the ceiling
    > are not expensive and may save lab personnel from daisy-chaining
    > power cords (which are trip and fire hazards and are likely to
    > violate fire ordinances). Temperature and energy input monitors on
    > important equipment (such as ultra-low temperature freezers) can
    > provide early warning before equipment failures. If possible, it
    > is desirable to have a generator for use with essential equipment
    > like incubators and freezers incase of an electrical outage.

-   **Electrical safety devices**. Labs should have Ground Fault Circuit
    > Interrupters (GFCI) in the electrical receptacles in order to
    > minimize the risks associated with electrical equipment (e.g.,
    > shock, electrocution). The GFCI should be tested at least once a
    > year, because they can corrode or become damaged. Learn how to
    > perform a test
    > [[here]{.ul}](https://inspectapedia.com/electric/GFCI-Test-Procedures.php).

-   **Eyewash and shower**. We recommend providing access to an eyewash
    > station, which may also be required by safety regulations.
    > Eyewashes can be plumbed in or you can buy single-use squirt
    > bottles with sterile saline solution (don't worry they're cheap!).
    > Remember that:

    -   Eyewash stations have a limited lifetime and need to be
        > replaced; set calendar reminders to do so.

    -   Fixed eyewash stations should be flushed monthly or per local
        > regulations.

> Emergency showers are typically only required if lab users will be
> exposed to "injurious corrosive materials" ([[ANSI
> 358.1)]{.ul}.](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/07/emergency-eyewash-station-shower-ansi-z358-1/#gref)
> Refer to the international standard [[ANSI
> 358.1]{.ul}](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/07/emergency-eyewash-station-shower-ansi-z358-1/#gref)
> for additional recommendations for eyewashes and shower equipment.

-   **Fire safety equipment.** Fire extinguishers and smoke detectors
    > are often legally required. It is also advisable (and often
    > required) for the lab to have sprinklers and a fire alarm. The
    > National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes require labs to
    > carry fire suppression equipment such as fire extinguishers and
    > fire sprinkler heads. Fire extinguishers should use carbon dioxide
    > or dry chemical (type A-B-C extinguishers) to put out fires. Water
    > is not a good option for labs. If you use combustible metals such
    > as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, consider Type D fire
    > extinguishers, which also use a dry chemical but dispense it more
    > gently. If you plan to work with highly flammable materials, first
    > consult with your local fire department. We also recommend keeping
    > a fire blanket on hand. Local fire departments and fire service
    > companies may inspect and fill fire extinguishers and offer free
    > training on their use. Fire extinguishers must be inspected by a
    > certified inspector annually. [[Refer to Chapter 6 Emergency
    > Procedures for more information on Fire
    > Safety.]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EPvDUiT99IYeUYyCBV6huDEGlorgYYbkAZze0YaUcA/edit#heading=h.jj8eb4yencmb)

-   **Ventilation**. If building a lab, consideration should be given to
    > installing a ventilation system that provides inward airflow
    > without recirculation. Many community labs moving into existing
    > buildings will not have that option but heating, ventilation, and
    > air conditioning (HVAC) professionals may be able to balance the
    > air in the lab to create a small negative pressure. If mechanical
    > ventilation is not available, windows can be opened but should be
    > fitted with screens to prevent insects from entering the space. If
    > you're able to design the lab, ensure it has separate air handling
    > units for offices, bathrooms, and other spaces. Chemical fume
    > hoods and biological safety cabinets may require their own
    > ventilation and space considerations.

Signage
-------

The lab is often full of signs, which is a good thing and important for
the safety of users. Many signs tend to go unnoticed by very regular
users of the lab. That said, signs serve as useful reminders and are
especially important for new users and for emergency responders to the
lab. Signs also instruct users where things are and help them understand
the lab rules (see some example signs from
[[BioCurious]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByIgvp7w4IABNDFjYTk2MzQtYmEzNC00ODAxLTljNTYtNmQxN2I2MzkzYjAx)).
Signage that indicates who to contact and what to do in an emergency
should be posted in conspicuous locations throughout the building.

Below is a list of signs that are useful and often required in the lab:

**Location Signs**

-   **Exits**. It is especially useful, and sometimes required by law,
    > to have signs indicating where the exits to the lab and building
    > are located in the event of an emergency and when people need to
    > exit quickly.

-   **Fire extinguishers.** Signage should be posted to identify the
    > location of the extinguisher. Also, consider posting details
    > regarding how to use the extinguisher.

-   **First aid kit.** The first aid station safety symbol should be
    > used as it indicates the location and availability of a first aid
    > kit.

-   **Eyewash station and safety shower.** Signs to identify the
    > location and availability of an eyewash station and safety shower
    > are important.

-   **Escape route.** A sign that shows the various egress routes in the
    > case of an emergency should be posted.

 

**Warnings, Caution Signs, and Symbols**

-   **Biohazard symbol.** The biohazard symbol warns of lab equipment
    > (e.g., fridges, freezers, centrifuges) that contains biohazardous
    > materials or could be contaminated with biohazardous materials.
    > These should only be used if the material warrants posting such
    > signage, e.g., the material is classified as Biosafety Level 2
    > (see [[Chapter 13 - Biological
    > Safety]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk))
    > and is likely or known to contain pathogens. This could include
    > materials such as blood samples or primary human cell lines.

-   **High voltage.** The high voltage warning symbol, which includes a
    > lightning bolt arrow in a yellow triangle, warns of voltage high
    > enough to cause serious injury or death. If working with high
    > voltage, consider using an isolation transformer and other
    > appropriate high-voltage safeguards and PPE. You can find guidance
    > on this topic elsewhere---this handbook focuses primarily on
    > biological and chemical safety. Signage should be posted that
    > indicates how to turn off the main power in case of an accident or
    > emergency.

-   **Specific dangers.** Additional signage that identifies specific
    > hazardous areas/equipment should be posted. Examples include: Wet
    > Floor; Sonicating - Do Not Enter; UV Light; Lasers in Use;
    > Cryogens; and Compressed Gas. Some signs will be required by law
    > in certain places but not others so check local requirements.

**Etiquette Reminders**

-   **No eating/drinking.** Inform lab members that eating and/or
    > drinking where hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored is
    > not permitted. Eating and drinking may result in the accidental
    > ingestion of hazardous materials, and food and beverages could
    > also contaminate your lab experiments. Food or drink containers
    > and utensils should not be stored, washed, or dried in the lab.
    > Refrigerators used for storage of research materials must not be
    > used for storage of food or beverages.

-   **Labeling reminders.** Remind lab users to properly label their
    > materials and reagents with the name of the chemical or biological
    > agent, their name, and the date, so that other members of the lab
    > are aware of the contents.

-   **Hand washing.** Reminds lab users to wash their hands both before
    > beginning work and when they are finished.

-   **No open flame.** Prohibits open flame devices, e.g., bunsen
    > burners. These are especially useful near flammable chemicals,
    > although some labs enforce a "no open flame" policy throughout the
    > lab.

-   **Waste.** Helps to ensure that users know where to dispose of
    > biohazardous waste versus recycling or regular trash.

 

**Chemical Signage**

-   Use signage to demarcate storage locations, cabinets, and equipment
    > that is dedicated for acids, bases, and flammables.

-   Organize stock chemicals by type, alphabetically, or other system
    > (e.g., [[Flinn
    > system]{.ul}](https://www.flinnsci.com/shelf-storage-pattern/dcat024/)).

    -   Label storage areas clearly so that chemicals can easily be put
        > back in the same location they were taken from.

-   Include signs pointing out the location of and instructions for
    > [[how to handle chemical
    > spills]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d21Y1GKdQOCveWHRxN33DnCbW2KnILwB/view?usp=sharing)**.**

-   Refer to [[Chapter 10 - Chemical
    > Safety]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E)
    > for more details on chemical safety, storage, and signage.

**PPE Reminder Signage**

-   Post signage in areas where extreme heat or cold is located. Always
    > wear heat-resistant gloves for handling items coming out of the
    > autoclave or microwave, as well as reminders for handling cold
    > items with protective gloves.

-   Incompatible glove signage should also be posted at corrosive
    > cabinets or chemical fume hoods as a reminder.

-   Reminders should be posted that describe when it is and isn't
    > appropriate to wear PPE, such as signs on exit doors reminding
    > people to remove lab coats and gloves before leaving the lab.

**Emergency Contact Information**

-   Provide contact information for each of the following:

    -   The lab manager(s), staff, or volunteers in charge.

    -   Any building personnel that can be reached in an emergency.

    -   Local fire department.

    -   Local police department.

    -   911, or country equivalent, emergency response number.

    -   For freezer emergencies, you may also want to post the nearest
        > locations that sell dry ice.

Types of Labs and Specific Considerations
-----------------------------------------

This section provides special guidance for different types of community
lab facilities.

-   **Rented Dedicated Lab Space.** A number of community labs rent
    > dedicated space from a commercial landlord. It's important to know
    > the zoning for such a space (usually biology labs require
    > industrial or mixed-use zoning but as with everything it depends
    > on local laws). It is your responsibility to make sure that your
    > landlord has a clear understanding of the types of activities at
    > your lab, your users, power usage, policies, and hours. The more
    > the landlord knows at the outset, the smoother your relationship
    > will be, and the less potential for conflict in the case of an
    > incident. We recommend occasionally inviting the landlord into the
    > lab as a way to establish a good working relationship.

-   **Kitchen or Other Home Lab.** The most challenging aspect of the
    > design of a home lab is the separation of the lab space from the
    > living space. It is important not to eat or drink in the space
    > where work is being performed. Avoid setting up a lab on carpeted
    > flooring and make sure that walls and furniture are impermeable
    > (or cover them with plastic tarp). Small dorm fridges and freezers
    > can be bought cheaply second-hand in any college town. If you have
    > roommates or family members who share the space, you may want to
    > mark off the space and establish an understanding about access and
    > safety in the lab.

-   **Basement or Garage Lab.** Paying attention to the airflow in a
    > garage or basement lab is critical. Too much airflow may increase
    > chances for sample contamination, but too little may not provide
    > adequate ventilation for users. Moisture and mold may also be an
    > issue---you can check mold levels using a simple petri dish kit
    > available at many home improvement stores.

-   **Makerspace (Conjoined or Mixed Use).** Separation of spaces to
    > reduce dust and vibration is important in a biolab within a
    > makerspace. It's essential to protect the bio area from other
    > makerspace members who may not appreciate the special needs of a
    > biolab. Chemicals and biologicals should be stored in cabinets
    > away from the shared space.

-   **Library.** Separate porous library books from lab space.

-   **University Spaces.** Be aware of rules and regulations of the host
    > institution and incorporate them into the policies of your own lab
    > space. We also recommend scheduling regular check-ins with the
    > management of the host institution and outreach events for your
    > neighbors. Be sure to mark off the lab from other spaces in the
    > host facility with lockable doors and clear signage.

-   **Mobile Lab (e.g., a Van or a Container).** Mobile labs come with
    > special considerations about establishing resilient containment
    > practices for chemicals and organisms. Accidental environmental
    > releases or spills are especially a concern with mobile units that
    > could be involved in traffic accidents. Contact your local
    > Department of Motor Vehicles or equivalent governing institution
    > for proper signage and containment procedures for these units.

Opening the Lab
---------------

Before work commences, it is a good idea to review the experimental
setup to check for any missing items that will help ensure a safe lab
experience for users. [[This
checklist]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjM2dbTXLQmATVbjQBWDfz5ocBT9KLeeE7LuHUzGWBA/edit?usp=sharing)
may be used upon moving into the lab. It can also be used for conducting
regular safety checks of the lab.

Decommissioning a Lab
---------------------

When relocating, renovating, or simply closing a lab, it may be
necessary to completely decommission the space. Ensure that no lab
materials are left behind and that all lab equipment, fixtures,
furniture, and space are properly cleaned and decontaminated to ensure
the safety of future occupants and others who may enter the space. You
may be legally required to perform a hazardous materials (chemical and
biological) walk-through upon ending your lease,which might involve
county or state documentation of disposal and closing permitting on
sites.

The steps involved in decommissioning involve the following:

### Assess and Audit

-   Assess any hazards that may need attention (e.g., historic records
    > of spills or accidents, known areas of contamination).

-   Determine the amount of time needed to decommission, and plan to end
    > research in the lab 1-2 weeks before starting the process.

### Clearout and Decontaminate

-   Remove all chemicals and biological materials from lab and storage
    > areas, including refrigerators and freezers.

-   Movable equipment should be appropriately cleaned and/or disinfected
    > and removed from the lab.

-   Decontaminate all surfaces of any chemical or biological
    > contamination. Pay particular attention to ethidium bromide
    > contamination in gel electrophoresis areas.

-   If mercury has been used in the lab, decommissioning should include
    > testing of floors (or under floor tiles), sink traps, cupboards,
    > and molding around furniture and walls. Contact a local
    > remediation company or a nearby college or university to determine
    > if a [[Jerome
    > meter]{.ul}](https://www.azic.com/jerome/jerome-431/) may be used
    > to test for mercury.

-   Remove dust and other settled particulates via a thorough final
    > wet-cleaning of floors, vertical surfaces, and furniture using
    > commercial cleaning products.

### Documentation

-   Keep notes of all of the processes.

This [[Decommissioning
Checklist]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjM2dbTXLQmATVbjQBWDfz5ocBT9KLeeE7LuHUzGWBA/edit?usp=sharing)
may be used to help keep track of all of the items to inspect and
complete when decommissioning the lab.

  Dispose of empty containers in the trash after removing all markings and writing "EMPTY" on the container; triple rinse empty acid containers before disposal; do not dispose of any chemicals in the trash or down the drain, regardless of hazard rating.                             
  Check containers for expiration dates and signs of corrosion crystallization; oxide-forming materials should be disposed of if the container has been opened and is more than six months old or if it has not been opened and is more than one year old                                 
  Remove all lab chemicals from the lab                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  Thoroughly check all storage areas to ensure no chemicals are left behind. Abandoned and unknown chemical containers can be difficult, expensive, and dangerous to dispose of properly                                                                                                  
  Clean and decontaminate all chemical cabinets, refrigerators, freezers, and any other chemical storage areas, benchtops, and equipment from any spilled chemicals                                                                                                                       

**4. Basics and What Members should Know**
==========================================

**Introduction**
----------------

One of the most exciting parts of community biology is lowering the
barrier to entry for working in a lab. This shift helps to democratize
access to science. It also teaches responsible community behavior such
as working alongside other lab members and collaboration. Consider
reading [["At the Bench: A Laboratory
Navigator"]{.ul}](https://www.amazon.com/At-Bench-Laboratory-Navigator-Updated/dp/0879697083)
by Kathy Barker for more information. It is a great guide for lab
members and managers that provides answers to difficult questions about
lab safety and procedures.

**Basic Training Required to Work at a Community Lab**
------------------------------------------------------

We recommend that labs offer orientation and training programs to help
users get familiar with the space, equipment, protocols, and safety
procedures. Offer an entry program that helps people get used to working
in the lab that is general and offers simple introductions to the
resources, safety equipment, and fire extinguishers. This can be
followed by more specific trainings for delicate, hazardous, or
expensive equipment and procedures.

**Suggested Minimum Training**
------------------------------

-   Emergency procedures, exits, fire extinguishers, emergency contacts

-   Lab hygiene, chemical and biological spills, clean up

-   Lab clothing

-   Lab equipment safety guidelines

-   Certification on restricted equipment

-   Community code of conduct

-   Waste disposal

-   Project-specific safety information based on project review (e.g.,
    > chemical or biological specific info)

**Lab Etiquette**
-----------------

Lab etiquette is essential for working in a shared space. It is a vital
way to ensure that the workload does not grow unmanageable as the
membership expands. Because members share the same lab benches,
materials, and equipment, it's important to set expectations about
cleanliness, equipment usage, and sharing policies.

Lab etiquette is an extension of a lab's "Code of Conduct." A Code of
Conduct establishes behavioral norms and is a social contract between
the organization and its members (For examples of Codes of Conduct, see
[[Lab Management
Practices]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3wZIbpP9qQFy1wVoam2oJu7RLL-Oh2Ld8-lmvtyEyU/edit#heading=h.ju1kbgwjpvj4)).
Lab etiquette covers more of the particulars on how the lab operates and
how to be a good lab user. It covers simple tasks: washing dishes,
cleaning up the work area, expectations on equipment usage, labeling,
and communication.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| BOX: Examples of poor lab etiquette include:                         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Borrowing buffers or solutions without asking permission: put    |
|     > contact information on buffers so users can call the owner of  |
|     > them and ask. If problems continue, lab management may need to |
|     > check access records to identify persistent offenders.         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Monopolizing equipment: add a note to let other users know when  |
|     > the experiment will end, where the sample can be stored, or    |
|     > how to contact the owner. When starting the autoclave, ask if  |
|     > anyone else has some materials to add. State clearly how long  |
|     > materials may be left in a device and what happens to them     |
|     > when they are removed.                                         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Taking incubations out even when they are on hold: provide       |
|     > signage that provides directions about what to do and how to   |
|     > tell if the equipment is on hold; provide an "in usedo not     |
|     > remove" tag, along with "your materials were removed after X   |
|     > days of inactivity."                                           |
|                                                                      |
| -   Moving materials in storage locations: everyone must label their |
|     > materials and provide signs about what is shared and what is   |
|     > not.                                                           |
|                                                                      |
| -   Poor care of shared resources (e.g., leaving open, empty,        |
|     > wasting supplies): provide signs with guidance and emphasize   |
|     > expectations during training.                                  |
|                                                                      |
| -   Taking up too much space in a shared storage space: Some labs    |
|     > give out "parking tickets" for leaving materials unclaimed or  |
|     > unlabelled items out. Ensure that a process for disposing      |
|     > unclaimed materials is written into the membership agreement.  |
|                                                                      |
| -   Overusing shared supplies: provide signage to direct people      |
|     > about the reasonable use of supplies. Set expectations during  |
|     > lab inductions of when users should consider buying their own  |
|     > supplies.                                                      |

**Basic Hygiene for Lab**
-------------------------

Many community lab directors have reported increased productivity,
community engagement, and general happiness when spaces are clean and
organized. Simple things like clear counters, empty sinks, uncluttered
hallways, and organized storage make a good and safe workplace.

We recommend developing and documenting lab decontamination practices.
If used appropriately, these procedures will become routine. For
example, lab benches and other surfaces should be cleaned and
decontaminated before and after every use, and lab benches should be
cleared of any unnecessary equipment. Some labs experiment with
demarcating areas for pieces of equipment with bright electrical tape or
by other means so it is clear when items have not been returned.

**Lab Security (Doors, Instruments, Keys, Hours)**
--------------------------------------------------

Labs should offer guidance on signing and signing out of the space.
Procedures should include:

-   Building access

    -   Key holder procedure (who holds physical keys)

    -   Hours of operation

    -   Sign-ins for all users (members, staff and guests)

    -   Tours

-   Access to lab

    -   Specific lab areas

    -   High-value equipment

    -   Off hours (e.g., working alone in the lab)

We recommend having locked access to the space and a sign-in/sign-out
protocol. These procedures help with overall safety/security,
understanding the general use of the space, and enable the collection of
metrics that can be used when developing grants and public funding. It
also helps when there is an emergency, stolen or damaged equipment, or
if lights are left on.

The sign-in process can be simple. It can simply be a piece of paper
with a waiver attached at the top of the page (see example table below):

**Example Sign-in Sheet**

Community Labs Sign In/Waiver Agreements

  Name   Member / Guest / Staff   Time In / Out
  ------ ------------------------ ---------------
                                  

More complex sign-in sheets can have tablets synced to a member database
allowing members to electronically sign membership agreements. This can
be tied to an RFID system as well. If the member has all of the safety
requirements, they are permitted entry into the space or use of
equipment. Community labs with staff or volunteers who are often in the
space can ask that they remind people upon entering the space to sign
in.

**Access to Specific Equipment**

We suggest labs restrict access to high-value or dangerous equipment.
High-value equipment is difficult to find and most likely very expensive
to repair if broken. There are several ways to restrict access: move the
equipment to a separate room; remove and lock away key parts without
which the equipment will not function, like expensive microscope
objectives or sample input pumps; place lockout tags on pressure
regulators; install access or power cord locks. RFID lockout solutions
are commercially available but expensive.

height="1.1197922134733158in"}

**Emergency Exits**
-------------------

A map of the emergency exits should be posted in highly visible public
areas, along with the location of flammable cabinets, compressed gas
cylinder, and other fire hazards. The leasing agent or landlord of the
space should be able to provide a general building plan and map of the
area for customization. This plan will help members and emergency
responders know how to evacuate and either avoid or address hazards in
the case of fire.

**Working Alone in the Lab**
----------------------------

A policy should be implemented to allow the use of the facility in the
evenings, weekends, and unusual working hours. Many experiments do not
follow normal business hours. As such, neither do accidents. Here are
some policies for labs whose users work in the facility alone:

1.  All users should be required to fill out an emergency contact form.

2.  Have members read and acknowledge a lone working policy including
    > the dangers of working alone.

3.  Quiz them on emergency procedures.

4.  Create a policy where lone users must inform another person that
    > they are working in the lab alone.

5.  Ensure that the sign-in and sign-out procedure is followed.

6.  Consider if there are any times where special permission should be
    > sought or restrictions imposed when members work in the lab
    > overnight or with dangerous chemicals.

7.  Include as part of projects risk assessments a section detailing
    > what procedures safe hours or experiments that should not
    > undertaken alone.

8.  Consider recording members' hours through RFID cards used to access
    > the lab. Video cameras might also be installed for both safety and
    > security reasons, but be mindful of privacy concerns and data
    > protection regulations in your area.

We recommend that individuals under the age of 18 never work alone in
the lab. A parent, guardian, or mentor should be the responsible party
and must be with them at all times, without exception. See [[Chapter 2 -
Lab Management
Practices]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3wZIbpP9qQFy1wVoam2oJu7RLL-Oh2Ld8-lmvtyEyU/edit#heading=h.z1ef6zaw5ax3)
for more recommendations on setting youth policies in your lab.

**Basic Clothing and Footwear** 
-------------------------------

Lab coats should be available for users along with other PPE such as
gloves and safety glasses. There are additional basic clothing,
footwear, and other considerations to take into account while working in
the lab.

-   Clothes should not be at risk of dangling in chemicals, biological
    > cultures, or of easily catching on fire.

-   Clothing should cover the skin (e.g., no shorts or short skirts).

-   No shoes with exposed skin or high-heeled shoes.

-   Long hair should be tied back.

-   No long or dangling jewelry, bracelets, or scarves, which could get
    > tangled in moving parts or snagged on items in the lab.

-   Remove rings that could puncture gloves.

Be prepared to ask people to change into clothes that are more suitable
for work in the lab if they arrive in unsuitable attire. Consider
providing hair ties and foot covers (booties). Remember that users will
not necessarily know all of the dangers in the lab, so reminding them
before activities such as workshops and posting a clothing and PPE
policy in a visible place is important.

For more information on clothing and PPE, see [[Chapter 8 - Personal
Protective
Equipment]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KhUmKDNtTEsN4u4oiUHs4RNZiWPN8_6X1w0IynYP70A/edit).

**Food, Beverages, Application of Makeup, or Contact Lenses in the Lab**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community labs should apply a strict policy that no food, beverages, or
gum be allowed in the lab because of the risk that food or drinks could
become cross-contaminated and then be ingested. If food and drink are
allowed in areas outside the lab, consider providing a separate fridge
and sink. Similarly, the application of contact lenses or makeup should
also be banned from the lab to avoid cross-contaminated with chemicals
or organisms.

**Housekeeping**

Paying for a professional biowaste pickup service is a valuable
investment in the biosafety of your space (see [[Waste
DIsposal]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s)).
Holding occasional cleaning parties (in conjunction with an event) can
be useful for tidying the lab. If the lab can afford to pay for general
housekeeping for bathrooms and common areas, we recommend considering
this as it is usually not too expensive and can really make the space
tidier.

**Trash, Clean Lab Benches, Cleaning Up Spills**

Volunteers and members should be trained in trash and general cleanup
techniques. Cleanup can also be a regular part of classes.

**Cleaning Up Spills**

A chemical and biological spill kit should be readily available in your
lab. They do not have to be complex for most spills, but they can help
greatly in preventing a spill from reaching a floor drain. Uline and
[[PIG]{.ul}](https://www.newpig.com/pig-spill-kit-in-5-gallon-high-visibility-economy-container/p/KIT2200?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5MLrBRClARIsAPG0WGzAagTasG-zT4MeCeRtFMO__UI__TM3LPsYjC2BqATnwf1CzVf8X_saAs_pEALw_wcB)
sell good basic kits, but you can more cheaply assemble your own kit.
See [[Emergency
Procedures]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EPvDUiT99IYeUYyCBV6huDEGlorgYYbkAZze0YaUcA/edit#)
for more information on spill kits dealing with spills.

**Signage and Labeling**

Signs and labels are essential components of lab safety. Basics that
should be labeled:

-   Storage locations

-   [[Emergency contact
    > information]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EPvDUiT99IYeUYyCBV6huDEGlorgYYbkAZze0YaUcA/edit#heading=h.ru8axmvj2uuy)

-   Instructions for cleaning

-   Contact information for questions on machine operation

-   Contact information for safety questions

-   Special equipment warnings (e.g., hot surface, under pressure, close
    > valve when finished, laser in use, before using this equipment you
    > must pass training)

-   Warnings about the building or structure

-   Emergency exits

-   Emergency equipment (e.g., electrocution hazard, fire extinguisher)

All chemicals and biological materials should be labeled, along with
every derivative. Please refer to the section on labeling in [[Chapter
10 - Chemical
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit)
and [[Chapter 13 - Biological
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit)
for more information.

**Emergency Response**
----------------------

We recommend having well-documented emergency response procedures and
making sure that all members are familiar with them. Ensure that
emergency contact information is clearly displayed in the space along
with non-emergency numbers and email addresses for issues like blown
fuses, broken lights, suspicious people, or unusual smells. For more
information, see [[Chapter 6 - Emergency
Procedures]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EPvDUiT99IYeUYyCBV6huDEGlorgYYbkAZze0YaUcA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103519764889495260290).

5. Codes of Conduct, Human Subjects, and Data Protection 
========================================================

Codes of Conduct
----------------

From its earliest beginnings the DIYbio community has incorporated
safety, security, and responsible conduct into its ethical principles.
The first iteration of a [[code of conduct was developed in
2011]{.ul}](https://diybio.org/codes/) when there were only a handful of
community laboratories (see below). It was They were a starting point,
enabling each community lab or DIYbio group to adapt and evolve the
codem over time.

![](media/image64.png){width="3.7864588801399823in"
height="3.8639588801399825in"}![](media/image1.png){width="3.8906255468066493in"
height="3.13916447944007in"}

As the community has grown, the codes have grown with it. In 2019, [[the
Global Community Biosummit]{.ul}](https://www.biosummit.org/) developed
and agreed to by consensus a [[community ethics
document]{.ul}](https://www.biosummit.org/ethics) that community labs
should incorporate into their own practices and continue to evolve over
time**.**

![](media/image52.jpg){width="6.5in"
height="9.194444444444445in"}![](media/image76.jpg){width="6.5in"
height="9.194444444444445in"}

**Human Subjects and Responsible Research (Including Public Outreach)**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When conducting sponsored human subjects research at institutions (e.g.,
universities) you often must receive institutional approval prior to
starting. In the U.S., this is typically done through the university
Institutional Review Board (IRB), and private for-hire IRB's exist for
research conducted outside universities. Similar systems exist outside
the U.S. The IRB's role is to advocate for and protect human subjects
who participate in research by reviewing research proposals and methods
with a lens towards ethics, legal compliance, and social justice. In
many instances, this type of review is required by the sponsor of the
research, and many journals will not publish work that has not been
reviewed/approved by such a review board.

Research ethics and its regulations will vary from country to country
and you should investigate what specific rules/regulations might cover
your experiments and public outreach events. It's important to remember
that many of the outreach activities described in this chapter may
require certain approvals or consent from individuals before they can
participate. When designing/conducting your public outreach events,
group projects and/or educational activities, consider issues such as
informed voluntary participation, confidentiality, anonymity, and
minimising harm.

While most public outreach activities a community lab conducts areis not
subject to human subjects research or similar type of approvals, we
recommend that you think about developing a review process and consent
form to both protect your lab from liabilities but more importantly to
maintain ethical research practices. *If you are collecting data
(including spit) from a minor, you will need to obtain consent from
their legal guardian(s).* The [[iGEM Human Practices
page]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Human_Practices/Resources) is a useful
resource, and we have reproduced some of that information below.

An informed consent form should address the following key points:

What information is being collected?
------------------------------------

1.  Who is collecting it? You will want to provide contact details for
    > your lab.

2.  How is it being collected?

3.  Why is it being collected?

4.  How will it be used?

5.  Who will it be shared with?

6.  What measures will be taken to ensure the participants' privacy and
    > confidentiality?

7.  How will participating affect the individuals concerned?

You should present in clear and plain language that:

1.  Their participation is voluntary.

2.  They have the right to terminate their participation at any point of
    > the data collection process without any adverse consequences.

For most projects you could simply ask for a verbal consent, but
depending on the type of project and data you might collect (DNA, etc.),
you may want to have a signed consent form. Either way a participant
must confirm that:

1.  They have had the chance to ask any questions regarding the project.

2.  They understand that their participation is voluntary and that they
    > could terminate their contribution at any time without
    > consequences.

3.  They agree to participate in the study and (if applicable) they
    > agree to be recorded.

If you plan on publishing your work you may be required to follow
additional specific research ethics guidelines. We recommend you
anonymise any data if you plan on publishing your work both on- and
offline, unless specific permission to use their name has been obtained.

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance**
--------------------------------------------------------

The [[iGEM Human Practices
wiki]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Human_Practices/Resources) is a great
resource explaining the [[EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR)]{.ul}](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en),
as well as other information regarding research ethics. We have
reproduced iGEM's guidance (in part) here:

Since May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been
enforced by the European Union (EU), which has a global effect. This law
gives EU citizens more control over their data. You may find that GDPR
requirements largely mirror a general norm of good practice in research
data protection in different regions. However, it is important to
highlight that the GDPR is wider in scope. You should familiarize
yourself with the GDPR if you are conducting outreach experiments
relating to citizens of the EU. Serious violations of the GDPR may lead
to penalties.

#### **The Scope of GDPR**

The GDPR applies to "personal data" and "special category personal
data."

Personal data is data about living people from which they can be
identified, either directly or indirectly. Examples of personal data
include name, location data, an online identifier, or one or more
factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
economic, cultural, or social identity of that person. We want to draw
your attention to the fact that personal data that has been
'pseudonymised' can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how
difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.

Special category personal data refers to sensitive personal data
revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, or
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of
genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a
person, data concerning health, or other biological characteristics.

The GDPR prescribes 7 principles relating to the processing of personal
data.

1.  **Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency**: Data should be processed
    > lawfully, fairly, and with the data subject's (e.g., your
    > interviewees' or survey participants') full knowledge and consent.
    > (Please read the Informed Consent section.)

2.  **Purpose limitation**: Data should be collected for specified,
    > explicit, and legitimate purposes and only used for these
    > purposes.

3.  **Data minimisation**: Data should be adequate, relevant, and
    > limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of your
    > project.

4.  **Accuracy**: Data should be accurate and, where necessary, kept up
    > to date; Inaccurate data, once detected, should be erased or
    > rectified without delay.

5.  **Storage limitation**: Data you collected can be stored for a
    > period after the Jamboree to allow traceability (e.g., we
    > recommend no longer than 6 months), after which personal data
    > should be safely destroyed or deleted.

6.  **Integrity and confidentiality**: Data should be processed in a
    > manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data. For
    > example, data collected from interviews or focus groups studies
    > should be stored in a password protected computer which protects
    > against unauthorised or unlawful access. Appropriate measures,
    > such as a password-protected backup drive, should also be
    > implemented to protect against accidental loss, destruction, or
    > damage.

7.  **Accountability**: This principle requires you to take
    > responsibility for what you do with personal data and how you
    > comply with the other principles. You must have appropriate
    > measures and records (e.g., signed informed consent) in place to
    > demonstrate your compliance.

**Special category personal data**: In addition to the above 7
principles, if you are collecting and processing special category
personal data, extra oversight is required to ensure the necessity and
legitimacy of your planned data collection and that all data will be
properly protected. To demonstrate your compliance, you will need to
have the following:

-   Institutional Research Ethics Committee review and approval

-   Data minimisation and minimisation of recruitment numbers

-   Anonymisation and other technical safeguards against accidental
    > disclosure and loss or corruption of research data

-   Institutional Research Ethics Committee review and approval

Depending on the nature of sensitive data you collect, you may also need
additional governance checks (including Health Research Authority
assessment for health research). While we recognize that most community
labs will not have institutional resources to assist them in navigating
GDPR issues, we recommend consulting with a local institutional
administration official for guidance whenever possible.

**Human Subjects Research and Other Activities Involving the Public**

There are many ways that you need to be careful with how you interact
with humans in your project even if you are not collecting or
experimenting with biomedical samples from humans. iGEM teams often
engage with communities to understand broader social concerns, much of
which involves talking with people, collecting information, analyzing
it, and presenting it before judges at the Jamboree and on your wikis.
This type of human subjects research is social science research.

In many cases social science research (such as surveys and data
collection from interviews) requires pre-approval from review boards at
your local institution and must comply with national guidelines. This
oversight is designed to ensure ethical conduct, including issues such
as privacy, voluntary participation, informed consent, and protection of
vulnerable populations.

It is iGEM's policy that all human subjects research conducted by teams
must be done in accordance with that team's institutional and national
guidelines, and teams must demonstrate their awareness of these
guidelines and their adherence to them. Teams are reminded they must
attest to compliance via their safety forms.

Copies of national guidelines, for many countries, may be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sites/default/files/2018-International-Compilation-of-Human-Research-Standards.pdf).
Many universities have an internal "Institutional Review Board" (IRB) or
"Research Ethics Committee" (REC) that is responsible for approving
human subjects research at that institution. Because of the time it can
take to fill out forms and receive IRB/REC approval (often weeks or
months), teams are strongly advised to begin the approval process as
soon as possible.

Demonstration of adherence to institutional policies should be seen as
minimum requirements, and we expect teams to go above and beyond in
demonstrating their commitments to responsible and ethical conduct. For
example, for teams that do not have established review committees at
their institutions (e.g., some community lab teams), we expect them to
consult with the international and national policies and other resources
and experts linked on the [[Safety
Hub]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Safety) and [[Human Practices
Hub]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Human_Practices) (see the [[How to
Succeed]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Human_Practices/How_to_Succeed)
section of the Hub).

6. Emergency Procedures
=======================

Introduction
------------

We recommend developing an emergency plan for different scenarios that
might occur at your lab. These might include injuries, fires, chemical
or biological spills, equipment failures, and natural disasters. The
success of your plan depends on everybody knowing the plan, reacting
quickly to an incident and putting the plan into action. The emergency
plan, as well as the roles and responsibilities, should be communicated
clearly to all members and users of the lab. Sample plans can be found
from
[[Biomakespace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1inP4DSocdOEsYaajojMCa6Mk8_OVhfQPAjcoKV1rIck/edit).

Emergency arrangements should be proportionate to risk of harm and based
on the [[risk
assessment]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/)
for the experiments being performed. Online resources are available for
incident response and forms used by first responders using the [[ICS
system]{.ul}](https://training.fema.gov/icsresource/icsforms.aspx) in
the U.S.. Local fire and safety organizations also provide great
resources for creating emergency plans.

Emergency Contact Details
-------------------------

Because contacting emergency services and the lab management is so
important in the case of an emergency, instructions and contact details
should be prominently displayed in the lab (e.g., on the back of every
lab door) so that anyone could find them. Below are some communication
tips in case of an emergency:

-   Have a list (or rotating list) of designated people who could be
    > contacted in an emergency. Keep in mind which individuals are
    > likely to respond by phone, have key expertise, and/or live close
    > to the lab.

-   Set up a cascade system. Several telephone companies offer services
    > where a single number can contact multiple numbers at once or an
    > ordered sequence of numbers until someone picks up (e.g., Google
    > Voice).

-   If your community lab has poor mobile reception, provide an
    > emergency landline or Voice of Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone.

General Emergency Plan Documents
--------------------------------

A step-by-step emergency plan should be provided for all members
covering a range of scenarios. Step one should always be looking after
your own safety first---assess the situation and make it as safe if
possible. If it is not possible, then evacuate while alerting others.

The evacuation plan should include a method of raising the alarm, routes
to evacuate the building, and where to assemble. This section describes
the procedures for dealing with different kinds of incidents that could
happen at a community lab.

Emergency plans should also include information on what first responders
need during an emergency. These materials may include: maps of the
building layout with information relevant to first responders; location
[[of chemicals including Extremely Hazardous Substances
(EHS)]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/epcra/final-rule-extremely-hazardous-substance-list-and-threshold-planning-quantities-emergency);
locations of shut-offs for electrical or water; high pressure shut off
locations; and larger area maps which include locations of schools or
gathering locations.

*Agencies that usually require information with the types of information
they might require:*

-   **City Hall**: Business operations information, emergency contact

-   **Police**: Alarm information, emergency contacts

-   **Fire Department**: Chemical inventory with amounts and hazard
    > class (usually, a format is provided), inspection for Fire safety,
    > emergency contacts, maps of location and layout (this includes
    > locations of shutoffs and chemicals)

-   **Environmental Health and Safety Department**: Chemical inventory
    > (similar or same as Fire Department); they may also require an
    > inventory of organisms and signage indicating biological organisms
    > or hazards are located; maps of the facility

Emergency Equipment and Kits
----------------------------

The following equipment may be necessary for emergencies. All lab
members should know their locations.

-   Emergency eyewash station(s)

-   First aid kit(s)

-   Fire extinguisher(s)

-   Fire blanket(s)

-   Chemical spill kit (see details in Chemical Spill section below)

-   Biological spill kit (see details in Biological Spill section below)

-   Emergency shower (only required if lab is using corrosive chemicals
    > that may cause injury)

-   Emergency landline phone (if mobile signal is not available)

-   Flashlights for use in power outages

-   Circuit breaker box

-   Water and or gas shut offs

-   Incident report forms (examples from
    > [[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing)
    > and
    > [[FEMA]{.ul}](https://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/assets/ICS%20Forms//ICS%20Form%20209,%20Incident%20Status%20Summary%20(v3).pdf))

Fire Safety Emergency Plan
--------------------------

One of the most important emergency procedures is knowing what to do in
the event of a fire or explosion. While rare, these incidents can lead
to loss of life and destruction of the lab.

### Fire Procedures

Document the fire procedure in the event of discovering a fire and
hearing a fire alarm. Ensure copies of the evacuation procedure are
visible in the lab and that your safety training includes a full walk
through, including location of fire alarm switches, extinguishers, fire
exits, how to open them, and where assembly points are located. An
example of an emergency plan is shown below. An example training guide
is available
[[here]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BsAFCwetBTr3i8s3aznZpigcwLzubyCQk8yVQDf4MTc/edit).

![](media/image56.jpg){width="5.6611253280839895in"
height="2.9427088801399823in"}

**Figure 1.** Example of a fire safety emergency plan.

**Fire Procedure Training**

All lab members need to be capable of sounding the alarm and evacuating
themselves from the building, and the safety training provided should
cover this. They should be instructed to:

-   Familiarize themselves with the fire procedures and escape routes.

-   Report to the Safety Team any concerns regarding fire safety.

-   Ensure that fire doors are not held open by fire extinguishers or
    > wedges and that fire exits are not blocked.

-   Comply with all site rules, including not smoking in or around the
    > building as applicable.

Lab users should be advised to make their experiments safe before
evacuating wherever possible, including:

-   Turning off all flames and other ignition sources.

-   Closing all hazardous material containers.

-   Closing the sashes on all fume hoods.

A case-by-case risk assessment and alternative fire evacuation procedure
will need to be undertaken for members and visitors who have
disabilities that might impact their safe evacuation.

Fire Extinguishers

Different fire hazards require different fire containment measures. For
example, electrical fires are best tackled with carbon dioxide
(CO~2~)--based fire extinguishers and should not be approached with
water-based fire extinguishers.

Show people the location of the fire extinguishers and ensure they are
aware of which one should be used for which type of fire. In the U.S.,
there are Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
[[requirements]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.157)
for employers to inform employees about fire extinguisher usage. It is
important to stress that they should only attempt to extinguish a fire
if:

-   It is safe to do so.

-   They are comfortable that they know what they are doing.

-   It is a small fire that could feasibly be extinguished.

There are organizations that offer fire safety courses, including
extinguisher training, that members could attend. We recommend
contacting your local fire service to ask about training opportunities
for your safety team and other members. Local universities may also have
fire marshall courses that you could join.

When purchasing fire extinguishers for the lab, check with local
regulations and insurers if they have specific requirements. Remember
that most extinguishers require inspections and servicing on an annual
basis.

**Chemical Fires and Explosions**

![](media/image22.png){width="1.265625546806649in"
height="1.265625546806649in"}

In case of chemical fires or labs where explosions are possible (e.g.,
with compressed gases or any explosive chemicals), an emergency plan
should include how firefighters can be made aware of these hazards.
Information should be available both online and in written form for
members to provide to the emergency services. Rooms containing
compressed gases should usually have a sign on the door like the one to
the left. Check local signage regulations for the exact design.

Emergency First Aid
-------------------

Basic first aid kits should include:

-   Bandaids

-   Adhesive Tape

-   Instant cold packs

-   Gauze

-   Antibiotic ointment

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Antiseptic solution or towelettes

-   Tweezers or forceps

-   Scissors

-   Gloves

For a longer list of possible first aid kit supplies, see
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-kits/basics/art-20056673).
In addition, in the U.S., OSHA provides an example of what to include in
[[first aid
kits]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.266AppA).

Most accidents will only be minor in nature (e.g., a paper cut or
accidental fall). However, serious injuries or illnesses can occur. To
ensure that a first aid emergency is dealt with appropriately, ensure
that:

-   First aid kits are available and their locations are clearly marked.

-   Location information and emergency numbers are clearly displayed in
    > each room so members can contact the emergency services and
    > instruct them how to access the lab (e.g., which entrance to the
    > building they should use).

-   All members should know how to contact first responders.

-   All members should know how to report accidents. We recommend having
    > a standard form to report accidents (see example from
    > [[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing)).

-   Members are encouraged to take first aid courses. Check with your
    > local fire department or Red Cross for free or affordable classes
    > offered to community groups.

-   A designated member should be responsible for inspecting and
    > restocking the first aid kits once or twice a year to ensure that
    > items are up to date.

Chemical Spills
---------------

If handled well, a chemical spill may be nothing more than a nuisance.
However, if not treated properly, they can also seriously disrupt lab
activities, injure people, and damage property.

It is important to have an emergency plan that addresses different types
and sizes of chemical spills. In most cases, small spills can be cleaned
up safely by the person who caused the spill, since they are likely to
be the most familiar with the chemical and its hazards. (Note that even
simple water spills should be wiped up promptly, because the next person
in the lab may not know it is harmless and may wind up wasting a lot of
their time dealing with a water puddle.) However, some spills may
require outside assistance, such as if the spill is large or hazardous.
Here is a sample [[guide for chemical
spills]{.ul}](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/guide-for-chemical-spill-response.html).

### Understand the Hazards in the Lab

Review Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) for the chemicals being used. They will
explain the recommended spill cleanup methods and materials, and the
required personal protective equipment. The following hazards are of
most concern for chemicals:

-   Flammability

-   Reactivity to air or water

-   Corrosion

-   High toxicity

### Developing a Chemical Spill Response Plan

The details of a spill plan depend on the chemicals being handled, the
quantities, and the risk of a spill occurring. Here's a [[sample
plan]{.ul}](https://ehs.princeton.edu/chemical/spill/procedures) from
Princeton as a resource.

A spill response plan should include:

-   Names and telephone numbers of individuals to be contacted in the
    > event of a spill.

-   Evacuation plans for the room or building if necessary.

-   Written instructions for using the spill kits to contain a chemical
    > spill, including release to the environment considerations (e.g.,
    > protect floor drains).

-   An inventory of the spill kits and personal protection equipment
    > (PPE) so that they can be checked after use and on a periodic
    > basis.

-   Documentation of how lab members should dispose of the chemical and
    > contaminated spill kit materials, tools, and clothing.

-   Written instructions for decontamination of the area following the
    > cleanup.

Include the spill response plans in safety training for all lab members.

### Make Spill Control Material Accessible

Most spill control materials are relatively inexpensive. These include
items like brushes, scoops, and waste containers that would be needed
during the procedure. See Box 1 for [[example contents of a chemical
spill
kit]{.ul}](https://ehs.princeton.edu/chemical/spill/procedures#Inventory)
that you can adapt to the needs of your lab. A variety of commercial
spill kits are available from lab safety suppliers, but read the details
carefully; some are "universal," while others are for specific types of
chemicals (e.g., acid absorbing or neutralizing).

Make sure the spill kit is readily accessible in a marked location that
all lab members are aware of and can easily reach.

Once the plan is in place, make sure that:

-   Members know what to do in the event of a chemical spill.

-   Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are easily accessible, ideally both on
    > paper in the lab and online.

-   Spill kits are easily accessible and members know where to find
    > them.

### Sample Spill Response Plan

The following procedures are generic and should be adapted to each
community lab and based on the relevant risk assessments. In general,
responsibility for clean-up rests with the person who caused the spill
unless they are injured or unable to do so. Any lab members handling
chemicals should have appropriate PPE and a spill kit readily accessible
as explained in the section above.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Box 2. Example Emergency Plan for Chemical Spills**                |
|                                                                      |
| **Step 1.** Alert other lab occupants and evacuate the room if       |
| necessary. If a volatile, flammable material is spilled, immediately |
| warn everyone, control sources of ignition, and ventilate the area.  |
|                                                                      |
| **Step 2.** Provide emergency first aid to any injured people.       |
| Ensure that contaminated clothing is removed immediately, where      |
| necessary cutting clothing away with first aid scissors rather than  |
| pulling it over the face or other uncontaminated areas of the body.  |
| Many lab accidents have resulted in preventable severe burns where   |
| people were too reluctant to remove the contaminated clothing or put |
| it back on afterwards. Flush the area with water under an emergency  |
| shower or with another cold or tepid running water source for at     |
| least 20 minutes. All those assisting must wear appropriate PPE with |
| a minimum of eye protection, lab coat, and suitable gloves.          |
| Contaminated clothing and PPE will usually need to be discarded as   |
| hazardous waste.                                                     |
|                                                                      |
| **Step 3**. Assess the extent of the accident and its seriousness.   |
| Refer to safety data sheets for additional information. Determine if |
| it is possible to contain the spill. This will depend on a variety   |
| of factors including:                                                |
|                                                                      |

| -   Hazardous characteristics of the spilled chemical(s)             |
|                                                                      |
| -   Location                                                         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Proper method for cleaning up the spill (see [[Spill cleanup     |

| **Step 4.** Stop the spill or accident from worsening if safe to do  |
| so using absorbent materials from the spill kit. After the chemicals |
| have been absorbed, use brush and scoop to place materials in an     |
| appropriate container such as a polyethylene bags or buckets for     |
| larger quantities.                                                   |
|                                                                      |
| **Step 5.** After cleaning up the spill, a simple report should be   |
| prepared to document what happened, why, what was done, and what was |
| learned. This documentation should be shared with the safety team    |
| and other lab users where appropriate to avoid similar instances in  |
| the future. According to ACS guidance, major incidents are almost    |
| always preceded by numerous near misses.                             |
|                                                                      |
| In case of a large spill, a spill of reactive or hazardous chemicals |
| or a serious accident, do not attempt to clean up. Call emergency    |
| services or other responders that are able to deal with the spill.   |
| Many waste management companies provide an emergency spill response  |
| service.                                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

It's always better to prevent a spill before it happens rather than
clean it up, so we recommend a series of steps to lower the risk of
spills. The following more detailed steps are also recommended by [[ACS
Guide for Chemical Spill Response Planning in
Laboratories]{.ul}](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/guide-for-chemical-spill-response.html).

### Assessing the Spill

The following chart will help determine the appropriate response in the
event of a liquid spill of a substance that is hazardous to health.
However, it should not be taken as absolute as some substances will be
considerably more toxic, reactive, or flammable than others, and a spill
of a chemical in one location may represent a higher risk than the same
type of spill in another location.Therefore, each spill must be judged
accordingly.

  **Category**           **Size**                           **Response**                                                                       **Materials**
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Small                  Less than 50ml                     Absorption or chemical treatment                                                   Paper towels, appropriate absorption spill kit, and/or neutralization
  Small to medium        50ml to 250ml                      Absorption or chemical treatment                                                   Appropriate absorption spill kit, and/or neutralization
  Medium to large        250ml to 2.5 liters                Absorption                                                                         Appropriate absorption spill kit
  More than 2.5 litres   Assess and notify Safety Officer   Consider the need for outside help and ensure nothing can enter rainwater drains   

### Further Considerations for Dealing with a Spill

Following a spill, it is recommended to document the incident as
thoroughly and as soon as possible. Everyone involved should review the
incident to identify what went wrong and possible steps to take to
prevent it in the future. Often, a recurrence may be prevented or
mitigated by using smaller quantities, using more robust containers,
using secondary containment, using alternative apparatus, or by revised
manual handling procedures.

**1. Prevent the spread of dusts and vapors.** If the substance is
volatile, flammable, or can produce airborne dusts, close the lab door
and increase internal ventilation (e.g., through turning on and raising
the sash on fume hoods) to prevent the spread of dust and vapors. Be
mindful that increased airflow may also cause spread of dusts so plan
carefully, e.g., if internal doors are opened, consider the direction of
airflow and the potential consequences of the vapor spreading through
the building. Any spill requiring the use of respirators and face masks
should be escalated to a professional company or to emergency services.

**2. Neutralize acids and bases, if possible.** Spills of most liquid
acids or bases, once neutralized, can be mopped up and rinsed down the
drain. However, care must be taken because neutralization is often a
vigorous, exothermic reaction that can cause splashes and yield heat.
For acids, they can be neutralized with soda ash or sodium bicarbonate.
Bases can be neutralized with citric acid or ascorbic acid. pH paper can
be used to determine if neutralization has been successful.

**3. Control the spread of the liquid.** Contain the spill by using
spill pillows or piles of absorbent materials around the outside of the
spill but not touching the chemicals (yet). If a spill or leak is within
an unopened or intact parcel, consider if the parcel be safely moved
outside to a suitable place away from drains before dealing with it.
Secondary containment should be used during transit to avoid
contaminating the building.

**4. Absorb the liquid.** Absorbent materials can include commercial
absorbent pads, pillows and granules, or cheap materials such as cat
litter or vermiculite which work well but are messy. Loose spill control
granules should be distributed in a circular motion working from the
outside to the inside over the entire spill area to reduce the risk of
splashing. If using absorbent mats, work from the outside toward the
center, carefully laying the mat onto the spill to avoid splashing or
spreading the spill. Large mats can be cut to size. For larger spills,
protect floor and rainwater drains by placing spill socks and absorbent
materials around them.

**5. Collect and contain the cleanup residues.** Neutralized residue or
absorbent material should be scooped, swept, or placed into a screw-top
plastic bucket or other container. For dry powders or where the liquids
have completely absorbed, double bag the residual waste using plastic
bags and put these in another container (e.g., screw-top bucket) as
required for safe transport to a hazardous waste store). For spills of
powders or solid materials, consider dust suppressant (e.g., water in a
spray bottle). Make sure to clearly label each container.

**6. Dispose of the wastes.** Keep cleanup materials separate from
normal waste. Ideally, provide hazardous waste bags and buckets with the
chemical spill kit. Polyethylene bags may be used for small spills but
always double bag. Polythene buckets or bins with clip-on lids are more
appropriate for larger spills if chemically compatible with the spilled
material. Label the waste container or bag and identifying the material
as spill debris with the chemical name and absorbent name. Remember the
use of a non-neutralizing absorbent does not alter the chemical
properties of the chemical. Store the spill debris until collected by a
hazardous waste contractor.

**7. Decontaminate the area and affected equipment.** Ventilating the
spill area once the spill is removed by opening windows or using a fan.
For most spills, conventional cleaning products applied with a mop or
sponge will provide adequate decontamination. For questions about the
suitability of a decontaminating agent, seek expert advice. Notify the
lab management and safety team of the situation and to replenish the
supplies of absorbents and other items used in the clean-up.

Biological Spills
-----------------

The other type of spill which may be classified as an emergency is of
microbiological material, particularly if it is genetically modified or
pathogenic. The degree of risk produced by a pathogenic spill depends on
the volume and concentration spilled, the route of transmission and the
severity of disease hazard produced by the organism. In most community
lab settings, which operate at Biosafety Level (BSL)-1, the risk to
health and the environment of any organisms in the lab should be low.

Below is a generic procedure for dealing with biological spills in a
community lab setting. If a project is using BSL-2 organisms in large
volumes, the risk assessment should consider alternative emergency
plans, including the need for face protection, an apron, and disposable
shoe covers. It may also be advisable to wear a high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filtered respirator instead of a surgical mask.
This should be decided in the risk assessment for the organism and would
need to be face-fitted to users who would undergo specialist training in
its use.

### Bleach

The most common disinfectant in the world is sodium hypochlorite and
there are a few important considerations for using this chemical
solution. Bleach is a broad-spectrum disinfectant used against many
biohazards. It is fast-acting and widely available at a low cost.
Household bleach contains 5.25 to 6.15 percent sodium hypochlorite, or
52,500--61,500 ppm available chlorine. Diluted bleach solutions, such as
10 percent bleach in water, rapidly break down and quickly lose
effectiveness. Shelf life of concentrated, undiluted bleach is one year
when stored at room temperature, so always store bleach containers in
cool, dark conditions to protect from sunlight. Undiluted bleach
liberates a toxic gas when exposed to sunlight.

Always check the sodium hypochlorite concentration on the label to
verify if bleach is effective for the material to be disinfected because
different organisms have different requirements. For example:

-   100 ppm of chlorine will kill ≥99.9% of Bacillus atrophaeus spores
    > within five minutes.

-   100 ppm of free chlorine inactivates 106 to 107 *Staphylococcus
    > aureus*, S*almonella choleraesuis*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
    > in less than 10 minutes.

-   Higher concentrations of 1,000 ppm or more of chlorine are required
    > to kill *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

-   Low concentrations of 25 to 500 ppm of chlorine are effective
    > against mycoplasma and vegetative bacteria.

Always prepare bleach solutions on the day needed and discard after use.
For a 1:10 dilution, or 10 percent solution, mix one part bleach in nine
parts water:

-   Work in a well-ventilated area.

-   Wear PPE consisting of a lab coat, eye protection, and gloves.

-   Use cold water to prevent chemical decomposition.

-   Label and date solution with preparation date and initials and
    > discard after use.

-   Remove PPE including gloves and wash hands thoroughly.

Bleach solutions are classified as an irritant and a corrosive. Chlorine
solutions should never be mixed or stored with cleaning products
containing ammonia, ammonium chloride, or phosphoric acid. Always know
where the nearest eyewash station and emergency shower are located when
working with bleach and review the Safety Data Sheet (SDS).

Avoid touching the eyes and skin when working with bleach. Contact with
bleach solutions can cause eye or mucous membrane irritation and burns.
If bleach gets into the eyes, immediately rinse with water for at least
15 minutes. If skin comes in contact with bleach, rinse with lukewarm
water for at least 5 minutes.

Contact with chlorine gases from bleach can cause nausea, eye
irritation, tearing, headache, and shortness of breath. If ingested or
inhaled, move to fresh air and seek medical attention immediately. When
exposure to bleach or any hazardous materials occurs in the lab, notify
the principal investigator and consider consulting with a medical
professional.

### Biological Spill Kit

Labs should have a biological spill kit prepared and maintained for use
at any time. Basic equipment for a spill kit includes:

-   Concentrated disinfectant (this should be appropriate for the
    > microbes used in the lab and be within its expiry date)

-   Container for mixing up disinfectant

-   Paper towels or absorbent pads

-   PPE such as gloves and any other that is determined by the risk
    > assessment for organisms used in the lab (e.g., respiratory
    > protection)

-   Biohazard and autoclave bags

-   Forceps or tongs to pick up sharps, broken glass

-   A small brush or scraper and dustpan to pick up powder and wetted
    > absorbent materials

-   Signage to prevent people entering the lab

### Dealing with Exposure

1.  Alert other lab members of the spill and avoid them entering the
    > area. If the spill is infected with a BSL-2 agent, post signage on
    > all lab entry doors to keep people from entering the spill area
    > and allow aerosols to disperse for at least 30 minutes before
    > re-entering the lab.

2.  If you or another member are exposed to the spillage, immediately
    > remove contaminated clothing and other protective equipment and
    > place in a biohazard bag for autoclaving.

3.  Wash contaminated skin with soap and water. Dispose of water and
    > paper towels in biological waste.

4.  If medical follow-up is warranted it should be sought immediately.

### Cleaning Up Low-Risk Spills

### General Spills on Benchtops or Floor

Where practical, the person who made the spill should clean up and
decontaminate the area. Follow the steps for cleaning up a benchtop or
floor spill:

1.  Put on a lab coat, gloves and eye protection.

2.  Collect the relevant spill kit.

3.  Place absorbent material around spillage to contain liquid and pour
    > or sprinkle disinfectant around the spill from outside to inside.

4.  Leave disinfectant for the length of time recommended by the
    > manufacturer (for more details on contact times for disinfectants,
    > see [[Working with
    > Microbes)]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8).

5.  Scrape disinfectant powder into a dustpan or soak up liquid using
    > paper towels or other absorbent material. Place in a waste bag for
    > disposal. Note that some disinfectants (e.g., Virkon) cannot be
    > autoclaved as they produce toxic gases when heated.

6.  If there is broken glass it should be picked up by disposable
    > forceps or a plastic scoop and disposed of in a sharps box.

7.  Wash and disinfect the area again with disinfectant according to
    > manufacturer\'s instructions (for more details see [[Working with
    > Microbes)]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8).

8.  Clean and leave the area to dry.

9.  Ensure that all material ends up in the correct waste disposal route
    > (sharps bin, biohazard bag).

10. Decontaminate used equipment and materials, e.g., scraper and
    > dustpan, with disinfectant before washing and reuse.

11. Inform Safety Team of the incident and complete an accident report
    > to document what happened, why and what was done, and what was
    > learned.

Important: Never dispose of materials that contain living organisms or
genetically modified organisms via sink or drains unless it has been
deactivated first (e.g., through the use of bleach or other
disinfectant).

### Spills Inside a Biological Safety Cabinet

1.  Keep the cabinet running.

2.  Soak up the spill with absorbent material and flood the tray of the
    > cabinet with disinfectant.

3.  Remove any contaminated PPE (e.g., lab coat) and isolate in a
    > biohazard bag to be autoclaved. Put on clean PPE, including lab
    > coat, gloves, and eye protection.

4.  Leave the disinfectant for the recommended time then collect and
    > dispose of the absorbent material through the biological waste
    > stream.

5.  If material has spilled into the catch basin beneath the work
    > surface:

    a.  Wipe down any items within the cabinet with disinfectant and
        > remove them.

    b.  Close the drain valve and wash the tray, drain, and catch basin
        > with disinfectant, allowing it to soak for the time
        > recommended by the manufacturer.

    c.  Lift out tray and remove exhaust grille work for cleaning all
        > surfaces (top and bottom) with a disinfectant solution.

    d.  Replace the tray and grill and dispose of disinfectant solution
        > by draining into a collection vessel or absorbing if the
        > volume is small enough.

6.  Thoroughly clean the safety cabinet with disinfectant, making sure
    > to wipe down back and side walls of cabinet.

7.  After completion of cleaning, allow the air blower in the cabinet to
    > run for at least ten minutes before resuming work.

### Spills Inside a Centrifuge

1.  Shut centrifuge off and do not open the lid for 20 minutes to allow
    > aerosols to settle.

2.  Put on PPE including lab coat and eye protection. If working with a
    > BSL-2 organism the risk assessment might indicate a respirator
    > mask.

3.  Use a squeeze bottle to apply disinfectant to all contaminated
    > surfaces within the chamber, taking care to minimize splashing.

4.  Allow a contact period equivalent to the manufacturer's
    > recommendation and then complete clean-up of the chamber.

5.  Remove buckets and rotors to disinfect and clean as per
    > manufacturer\'s instructions.

### Bodily Fluid Spills and Clinical Waste

The following procedure applies to human bodily fluids or materials such
as blood, urine, vomit, saliva, or feces. Primary human tissues and
fluids are not typically permitted in community labs which operate at
BSL-1, but such a spill may occur due to lab user illness or injury.

1.  Alert lab members of hazard.

2.  Any splashes of blood or bodily fluid on the skin should be washed
    > off immediately with soap and water.

3.  Put on PPE, including lab coat, gloves, eye protection.

4.  If there is broken glass, this should be picked up by disposable
    > forceps or a plastic scoop and disposed of in a sharps bin.

5.  Cover blood spillage with absorbent material, or if not available,
    > disposable paper towels or cloths and apply disinfectant. *Mops
    > should not be used to clear up bodily fluids because of the risk
    > of cross contamination*.

6.  Leave for 3 minutes, then clean up the contaminated paper towels or
    > cloths and place them in the disposal/biohazard bag.

7.  Thoroughly wash the area with detergent and hot water and dry.

8.  Clean and disinfect dustpan and brush.

9.  When cleaning feces, vomit, or urine follow the same guidance and if
    > possible, scoop up excess fluid and dispose of down the toilet.
    > The area can then be washed with hot water and detergent and
    > thoroughly dried.

10. Inform the Safety Team of the incident and fill in an accident
    > report form (see example from
    > [[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing)).

### Unidentified Spill

If a spill is unidentified follow the most stringent procedure based on
organisms and chemicals that are known to be present in the lab and the
circumstances surrounding the spill, including its appearance, smell,
and other clues. Investigate promptly what the spill might be to take
further appropriate action.

Other Lab Emergencies
---------------------

It is worthwhile considering other situations that might arise in a
community lab that might be classified as an emergency (i.e., without
rapid action there is a high likelihood of injury or damage). A useful
exercise might be to compile a risk register of the events that would be
most damaging to the lab, even if they are unlikely. Keep a copy of all
emergency response plans in a common, easy to find place in the lab.

### -20°C or -80°C Freezer Emergency

Procedures for freezer failures should be posted on the freezer itself
so that users can alert the lab management and initiate the backup plan
to ensure samples and reagents are saved. This should include:

-   Who to contact, including telephone number and email.

-   What action to take immediately, e.g., do not open the freezer to
    > avoid further heating, switch on the generator.

-   Where to purchase dry ice if applicable.

-   Where to find coolers, if applicable, or alternative storage spaces.

Having a backup freezer or an arrangement with another lab to use one of
their freezers in an emergency is recommended. Freezer users should
ideally be immediately contacted through a mailing list, text message,
or other mechanism. Any delay in repairing the issue or finding
alternative freezer space may damage the materials and some users may
prefer to make their own arrangements for backup freezer space (and
should be encouraged to do so).

Dry ice is useful to buy time in the event of a power outage or freezer
failure. Dry ice sublimates at -78.5**°**C, so it can be used to keep
even a -80**°**C freezer cold for a significant amount of time. It is
possible in many places to obtain dry ice on a next day delivery
service, and in the U.S. it is available in some supermarkets or gas
stations.

### Major Equipment Failure

Autoclaves and centrifuges can undergo catastrophic failures, which at
best damage the equipment but have the potential to cause damage to
surrounding equipment and the fabric of the lab. Members should know who
to call in the event of such a failure, the damage can then be assessed
and insurers contacted if necessary (see [[Chapter 9 - Equipment
Usage/Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit?usp=sharing)).
If the centrifuge failed and contained hazardous biological materials
(see the [[Spills Inside a
Centrifuge]{.ul}](#spills-inside-a-centrifuge) section).

In case of electrical failure (e.g., a piece of equipment is sparking or
emitting smoke), unplug the equipment from the outlet if it is safe to
do so (keep in mind that the power cord may be very hot!) or switch off
the circuit at the breaker panel (you should have labeled all breakers
for this specific reason!).

### Natural Disasters and Other Major Incidents

Natural disasters and major incidents will largely be covered by general
emergency and evacuation procedures. However, consider having agreements
in place with other labs to rescue any salvageable materials from
storage, fridges, and freezers in the event of a catastrophic emergency
and to enable projects to continue. Be familiar with your organization's
insurance policy and what is or is not covered. You will need to
determine the time you can expect to wait for a payout and make
arrangements to keep operating if possible.

If any animals are kept in the lab, consider what would happen to them
in the event of a major emergency.

 

Emergency Communications
------------------------

### Before the Emergency

Every emergency is different. However, a standard set of resources and
tools should be developed that will be useful to have in many
situations. In addition to a step-by-step emergency communications plan
for first responders and lab management, the following
[[information]{.ul}](http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/national_emergency_communications_plan.pdf)
would be useful to have before an emergency occurs:

-   List of internal contacts (e.g., members)

-   List of external contacts (e.g., media, government agencies)

-   An emergency contact directory (see sample below)

-   A simple incident report (examples from
    > [[FEMA]{.ul}](https://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/assets/ICS%20Forms//ICS%20Form%20209,%20Incident%20Status%20Summary%20(v3).pdf)
    > or
    > [[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing))

-   It may be helpful to have templates for press releases and web
    > announcements.

### During the Emergency

The following information might be needed during the emergency:

-   Incident report form that has been started

-   Information relevant to the nature of the emergency: maps, chemical
    > inventory, shut offs

-   Confirmed location of all lab users

-   Updated status reports on the incident

-   List of people contacted by the designated media contact

-   Notes on actions taken and resources needed and obtained

-   A live narrative to responders of the incident would be very helpful
    > for handovers: what happened what was done, the results, and the
    > outcomes

-   Any changes to the emergency response and communication (e.g., spill
    > that changed to a fire)

### After the Emergency

After the emergency has ended, account for all lab members and other
people involved in the incident. Document all actions taken and
otherwise close out the incident, including:

-   Confirmation that all lab members and users are safe.

-   Final status reports on the incident, including what happened, what
    > was done, the results, and lessons learned.

### Media Communications

While the safety of the lab and its members is the priority for an
emergency plan, if an incident occurs that could have public and media
interest (e.g., a breach of GM containment or a serious lab accident),
there should also be a plan in place for dealing with internal and
external communication. This should be handled by a member of the lab
management team to avoid distracting too much effort and attention away
from the larger task at hand.

It is recommended that all members know what to do if approached by the
media and where to direct the enquiry.

An emergency communications plan should:

1.  Have buy-in from lab management and members. Review the
    > communication plan with the lab leadership and members to ensure
    > that everyone is onboard with the plan. Avoid confused, unclear
    > messages that could result in unfavorable media coverage, negative
    > public relations, and possibly cause legal problems.

2.  Designate a single media contact. Instruct those who are contacted
    > by the media to channel all requests to the designated person
    > media contact.

3.  The designated media contact should focus on providing relevant
    > information in a proactive and timely manner. Tell the truth about
    > the situation, and rapidly resolve incorrect information or
    > rumors. Avoid confused, unclear messages that could result in
    > unfavorable media coverage, negative public relations, and
    > possibly cause legal problems.

4.  Ensure that materials such as press release forms and lists of
    > contacts are up to date.

5.  Be flexible. A basic plan template and supporting document files
    > should be sufficient for managing most emergency situations.

Reporting and Debrief After Emergencies
---------------------------------------

### Internal

Lab management and any relevant committees or teams (e.g., Directors,
Safety Team), should debrief as soon as possible after an emergency. Lab
users involved in the incident should also be given a chance to discuss
and debrief and reflect on anything that could prevent the incident in
the future. If injury or serious damage has occurred, consider the
mental well-being of the members as well as more practical debriefs.

### External

In addition to proactive internal communication, maintain communications
with building or facilities managers and landlords where applicable as
well as local authorities if they are involved in the incident (e.g.,
fire department, public health).

In some cases, reporting to local or national authorities will be
required by regulation. Check if the incident is reportable and to whom.
Breach of containment of GM organisms will always be reportable in
Europe and may be under some circumstances in the U.S. (including to the
local Environmental Health & Safety officer, possibly EPA or USDA, and
any federal funding agencies). Check local laws and include this in the
emergency plan.

You may also need to report events to your insurer if there has been
damage to property or if a claim will be received under public or
employee liability insurance. The more documentation and contemporary
information (e.g., photos and other evidence) the better so following an
emergency communication plan will be beneficial for this process.

Security
--------

Security issues that are in progress, such as unauthorized personnel on
the premises, unsecured windows and entrances, or a crime that is being
or has recently been committed (e.g., a burglary) should typically be
dealt with by contacting the police and then the lab management. If the
issue is not an emergency but could become a more serious problem, e.g.,
unsecured windows or doors, then the lab management should be contacted
to address the problem as soon as possible if the member who discovered
it is unable to deal with it themselves.

If there are additional security resources that can be accessed by
members in an emergency (e.g., if the lab is hosted by a university or
other organization with their own security guards), ensure that members
know of these services and their contact details are included in your
emergency contact lists.

**7. Biological Risk Assessments for Community Laboratories**
=============================================================

**Conducting a Risk Assessment**
--------------------------------

**"If you have one person doing your risk assessment, you have one risk
opinion."**

Working with biological and chemical materials and specialty equipment
has inherent risks. In general terms, risk is the probability of an
adverse effect occurring as a result of a consequence (i.e., an exposure
to a hazard such as heat, a corrosive chemical, or a biological
organism).

Risk = P x C

*P = Probability of an event occurring (Probability addresses factors
that affect*

*whether or not the exposure event occur)*

*C = Consequence of the event (Consequence addresses factors that affect
the*

*severity of the exposure event)*

According to the [[United Kingdom's Health and Safety
Executive]{.ul}](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/media/departmental/healthsafetyenvironment/riskassessment/indg163(v2).pdf),
"A risk assessment is simply a careful examination of what, in your
work, could cause harm to people, so that you can weigh up whether you
have taken enough precautions or should do more to prevent harm." Harm
to the environment and the organization may also need to be taken into
account.

Said another way, a risk assessment is a method to identify and mitigate
uncertainty to an *acceptable* level. Sometimes the acceptable level of
risk is laid out in regulation, but most often it is subjective and
different people and organizations will have different levels of
tolerance for the same risk.

A biological risk assessment (in contrast to a general risk assessment)
is the process of identifying the hazardous characteristics associated
with a biological material or system (e.g., viruses, bacteria, DNA, or
mixtures) that could result in harm or adversely impact the environment.
It considers the biological materials or systems and ascertains
appropriate risk mitigation measures. For example, if an individual is
using a pathogenic agent in the community space, an exposure could
result in an infection or illness. Requiring unnecessary safeguards
could be burdensome and expensive for the lab with little safety
benefit. A biological risk assessment should be performed to help select
appropriate containment facilities and equipment, safety devices, and
other controls to help protect individuals working in the space.

While many people tend to err on the side of caution, a risk assessment
requires thoughtful consideration. Determining acceptable risk is a
subjective process to help define whether a risk is high or low, and
ultimately whether it's acceptable or not.

A risk assessment matrix, as shown below in Figure 1, demonstrates the
probability or likelihood of an event occurring along with its severity.
The risk assessor must make value judgements about what is acceptable,
tolerable, undesirable, or extreme. Once this assessment is made, it is
useful to determine which protective measures are most effective
proportional to the risk.

Risk Assessment Strategy
------------------------

The European Union's Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental
Risks has developed a [[risk assessment
process]{.ul}](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_048.pdf)
for contained use (usually meaning use within a laboratory) of
genetically modified organisms, which may be useful for community
biolabs. It relies on four steps which are explained in more detail in
the sections below:

1.  Identification of biological hazards (i.e., any harm that could be
    > caused to health or the environment by the biological materials
    > being used).

2.  Determination of the risk group of the Genetically Modified Organism
    > (GMO) being used. This indicates the likelihood of it causing
    > disease in healthy humans.

3.  Consideration of the consequences of exposure to and release of the
    > organism being used.

4.  Classification of the overall risk of the activity.

### Step 1 - Identification of Biological Hazards

The first step of the risk assessment process is to understand the
materials being used in the experiment. It is important to know if the
biological materials pose a hazard to humans, animals, or the
environment. In order to assess risk, it is necessary to ask several
questions, including:

-   Will an exposure to an agent cause an infection or disease?

-   Will a release of the material potentially cause harm?

-   Will the DNA modifications being made increase infectivity or allow
    > it to compete in the environment?

-   What are the characteristics of the GMO or pathogen being used,
    > which may cause adverse effects to human or animal health or the
    > environment?

Note: If working with microorganisms, the CDC/NIH manual, [[Biosafety in
Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html), and the NIH's
[[Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic
Acid
Molecules]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih-guidelines/)
provide a starting point for determining the hazards associated with the
common pathogenic agents.

The risk assessment of the contained use activities involving pathogens
and of activities involving GMOs should be carried out on a case-by-case
basis (meaning that it depends on the GMO or pathogen concerned, the
introduced genes, and the intended use) while being based on established
science (i.e., known scientific facts, results published in recognized
scientific journals).

### Step 2 - Determination of the Risk Group

The risk assessment should be based on the Risk Group (RG) of the agents
being used, if known (see Table 1). Agents are classified into four RGs
according to their relative pathogenicity for healthy adult humans.
Please be aware that most GMOs have not been assigned a risk group.

**Table 1. Basis for the Classification of Biohazardous Agents by Risk
Group (RG)**

  **Risk Group 1 (RG1)**   Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Risk Group 2 (RG2)**   Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are *often* available
  **Risk Group 3 (RG3)**   Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions *may be* available (high individual risk but low community risk)
  **Risk Group 4 (RG4)**   Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are *not usually* available (high individual risk and high community risk)

The most critical properties inherent to the biological material that
should be considered for a risk assessment include:

-   Severity of disease or infection

-   Infectivity (virulence of the organism, infective dose, mode of
    > transmission, natural route of infection)

-   Host range of the microorganism and spectrum of specificity of
    > target species

-   Biological stability

-   Potential of survival and dissemination in the community or the
    > environment

-   Availability and effectiveness of prophylactic or therapeutic
    > measures (such as vaccination or antisera, antibiotics,
    > chemotherapeutic agents, taking into consideration the possibility
    > of the emergence of resistant strains)

The classification of the biological risk of plant pathogens includes
three additional criteria including:

-   Prevalence of the microorganism in the environment

-   Presence of target species around the installation or the site of
    > waste disposal

-   Exotic characteristics of the microorganism

For genetically modified microorganisms, each part or element used for
the genetic modification should be evaluated as well as the following:

-   Recipient microorganism

-   Genetic material inserted (originating from the donor organism),
    > function/activity, gain of use, whole operons, [[mobilized vector
    > elements]{.ul}](https://cmr.asm.org/content/31/4/e00088-17),
    > location of insertion

-   Vector, expression system, antibiotic resistance, selection
    > mechanism, viral proteins

-   Donor microorganism or organism

-   Resulting microorganisms (note that genetically engineered probiotic
    > bacteria pose an underappreciated risk, since they can be passed
    > person-to-person more readily than other RG-1 lab strains)

### Step 3 - Consideration of the Outcomes from Exposure to and Release of Potential Biological Materials

When considering the type of activity in terms of probability of
exposure to potential biological materials, not only should risk factors
inherent to the biological material be considered, factors associated
with the type of operations and modifications should be examined as
well. This includes:

-   Potential for aerosol generation

-   Scale of the activity

-   Concentration and volume (e.g., cultures, supernatants)

-   Type of work proposed (e.g., in vitro, in vivo, challenge studies,
    > work with lab animals, non-standardised manipulations)

Below is a graphic from [[ABSA International]{.ul}](https://absa.org)
with an overview of considerations when conducting a risk assessment. Be
sure to account for a lab member's experience and health status.

=================================================================================

from [[ABSA International]{.ul}](https://absa.org).

### Step 4 - Assignment of a Class of Risk for the Contained Use Activity 

The properties inherent to the recipient organism, the genetic material
inserted, the vector and the resulting GMO, and the characteristics of
the activity are then considered together in a final risk assessment,
leading to the assignment of a class of risk of the contained use
activity.

The class of risk of the activity defines the level of the recommended
containment level. The class of risk of the activity may be equivalent
to the class of risk of the microorganisms or it may be higher or lower.
Each level of containment implies the set-up of technical requirements,
specific equipment, work practices, and other protective measures.

-   **Class 1:** Contained use of no or negligible risk for which
    > containment level 1 is appropriate to protect human health and the
    > environment.

-   **Class 2:** Contained use of low risk for which containment level 2
    > is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.

-   **Class 3:** Contained use of moderate risk for which containment
    > level 3 is appropriate to protect human health and the
    > environment.

-   **Class 4:** Contained use of high risk for which containment level
    > 4 is appropriate to protect human health and the environment.

It is also important to be aware that a risk assessment should always be
carried out on a case-by-case basis and under normal condition and
single fault condition.

Sample Risk Assessment Forms
----------------------------

Community labs, such as Biomakespace, use a [[risk assessment
form]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlN4RccKxdLOih225oKfjHJIWneAz_LCAjdB6MslhuA/edit)
which guides people through the various aspects of the risk assessment.
Examples of completed risk assessments have been provided by biosafety
agencies in the
[[UK]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part2.pdf)

8. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
======================================

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) includes items such as lab coats,
safety glasses, and gloves that are designed to prevent accidental
exposure of the wearer to hazardous biological or chemical substances or
from heat, cold, and projectiles. The main thing to remember when
considering PPE is that PPE is not a substitute for other control
measures such as removing the risk (e.g., not using a hazardous
chemical) or introducing engineering controls (e.g., use of a fume
hood). PPE has serious limitations! For example:

1.  It only protects the wearer; others may be exposed to the hazard if
    > not also wearing the same level of PPE.

2.  Every failure could expose a user to danger. If something goes wrong
    > (e.g., a glove rips) then the wearer is potentially exposed to the
    > hazard.

It is important to always match the type of PPE and level of protection
to the individual, the particular substance, organism being used, and
how it is used. This should be informed by the risk assessment (see
[[Chapter 7 - Biological Risk Assessments for Community
Labs]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/edit#),
[[Chapter
10]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit#heading=h.ndd5oqn4aa6o)
- [[Chemical
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit#heading=h.ndd5oqn4aa6o),
and [[Chapter 13 - Biological
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit)).

In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) requires that employers pay for most PPE being used. Guidance
from OSHA on this topic is available
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/intro_osha/7_employee_ppe.pdf).

General Lab Clothing
--------------------

Wear appropriate clothing in the lab to provide basic protection against
skin exposure. This includes:

-   Footwear that completely covers the feet (no sandals or
    > slipper-style shoes).

-   Clothing that covers the legs (no shorts).

-   No loose clothing, including scarves or dangling sleeves.

-   Long hair should be tied up to avoid it getting caught or
    > contaminated.

-   In some cases, avoid wearing synthetic clothing, which may burn or
    > dissolve when working with flammable chemicals and solvents.

### Laboratory Coats

Because personal clothing is not designed for protection, lab coats are
a good idea to provide protection to the wearer's skin and personal
clothing from accidental contact and small splashes from hazardous
chemicals and biological substances. They also absorb or deflect tiny
particles that you may not notice such as aerosols and dust. They are
removable in the event of a splash or an accident and offer some
protection against flash and fire. If the coat starts to burn or char,
you may remove it to avoid injury.

Some labs recommend that all people wear lab coats in areas where
hazardous substances are actively used or GM organisms are being
manipulated (check local GM regulations). Remember that even if an
individual is not working with these substances, they may be exposed if
someone else in the lab is doing so.

Community labs should have clear policies about when people are expected
to wear lab coats. These policies should be based on a risk assessment
of the activities being undertaken. Check your local regulations. For
example, in the UK it is a [[regulatory
requirement]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part3.pdf)
for suitable protective clothing to be worn in labs using genetically
modified organisms and this would normally be a lab coat.

#### Lab Coat Features

Lab coats come in a variety of styles and materials and should be
selected according to the hazards the user is most likely to encounter
([[NIH Guidance for the Selection of Laboratory
Coats]{.ul}](https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/Documents/Guidance%20for%20the%20Selection%20of%20Laboratory%20Coats.pdf.pdf)).

Ideally, lab coats should:

-   Have snaps rather than buttons so they can be swiftly ripped off in
    > the event of an accident.

-   Fit properly, covering the arms and down to the knee or slightly
    > below---provide sizes that suit the members of the lab or
    > encourage them to purchase their own.

-   Be made of an appropriate material for hazards to be encountered.

#### Lab Coat Materials

When selecting a lab coat you should consider:

-   **Comfort**: Is the fabric heavy or lightweight? How breathable is
    > it?

-   **Flammability**: How quickly will it catch fire and will the fabric
    > melt and stick to the skin of the wearer if it does?

-   **Autoclavability**: Can you autoclave it to inactivate a biological
    > spill?

In general, polyester-cotton blends are most suited to biology labs
because they are lightweight, easily laundered, and autoclavable. That
said, they melt easily and stick to the body causing severe burns, so if
you frequently use flammables chemicals or flame spreaders and other
instruments using ethanol and naked flames, then consider finding a
cotton polyester (75% cotton, 25% polyester blend) coat that has been
treated to be flame resistant. Northwestern University has produced an
enlightening [[video]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quTegBMio6U)
demonstrating the flame resistance of some different lab coat materials.

Disposable coats are typically designed for clean room settings, short
term use by visitors, and in some instances, for use of highly hazardous
materials. They should be disposed of and not used multiple times. If
used for visitors they should provide adequate protection against the
hazards those visitors may encounter.

#### Where and When to Wear Lab Coats

Guidance should be put in place around how and where lab coats are to be
worn. In general, if the answer to any of the following questions is
yes, you should wear a lab coat:

-   Is there a risk of hazardous chemical or biological substances
    > splashing onto me?

-   Is there a risk of hot liquids splashing onto me?

-   Is there a risk of a fire or naked flame being near me?

-   Is there a risk that non-hazardous organisms that need to be
    > contained (e.g., genetically modified lab strains of bacteria)
    > could splash onto my personal clothing and be transported out of
    > the lab?

If lab coats are needed according to the risk assessment they should be
worn fully fastened, put on immediately after entering the lab, and
removed immediately before exiting. They should ideally not be worn
outside the work area to avoid contaminating other spaces. Refreshment
areas should always be designated lab coat--free areas. Note that it may
not be practical for lab coats to be entirely banned from communal
spaces, particularly if people frequently need to move between adjacent
labs.

Always consider why a lab coat is needed and whether decisions are based
on safety or pragmatism. For example, biological materials being
transported between labs should be double-contained and therefore not
pose a risk to staff or the general public from a spill. Therefore, it
is not necessary to routinely wear lab coats when moving samples between
rooms if you have more than one lab space.

Signage may help remind people where they should and shouldn't wear lab
coats. When not being worn, lab coats should be kept in appropriate
storage, e.g., coat hooks adjacent to work area.

#### Laundering Lab Coats

Lab coats should be laundered regularly, ideally every month or two if
worn frequently. They should be laundered immediately if contaminated.
In both cases, the type and level of contamination should be considered.

In case of biological contamination, lab coats used in a BSL-2 biology
lab or in any GM lab should be autoclaved or chemically disinfected
before laundering. We recommend using a professional industrial laundry
service who are set up for washing clothing from labs and/or hospitals.
If this is not an option for your community lab and you have only been
exposed to BSL-1, non-GM organisms, then as a last resort you could use
a domestic machine. However, most don't reach high enough temperatures
to kill all microbes so coats should also be autoclaved/disinfected
before being removed from the lab and should be kept separate from other
laundry.

In case of chemical contamination, the course of action will depend on
the extent of the contamination and which chemical(s) are on the coat.
If the coat has soaked up a substantial chemical spill or is
contaminated with a chemical that is highly toxic, corrosive, or
persistent then the lab coat must be bagged and discarded according to
hazardous waste disposal procedures and not washed. It could pose a
hazard to the person doing the laundry and contaminate other clothing as
well as releasing chemicals into the water waste stream.

If the chemical is not regulated as hazardous waste, is typically
disposed down the sink, and does not have unique health and safety
considerations, wash the lab coat in the lab sink and rinse well before
laundering. Do not autoclave a lab coat when chemical contamination is
suspected because it may harm the autoclave or autoclave operator.

Eye Protection
--------------

Eye protection (safety glasses, chemical resistant goggles, or face
shield) reduces the risk of damage to the face and eyes by chemical and
biological splashes, aerosols, hazards, or flying debris. It might also
protect from radiation such as UV light. Eye injuries are painful and
sometimes permanent, and all it takes is a momentary lapse!

### When Do You Need Eye Protection?

It is good practice to wear protective eyewear in the lab, whether or
not you are doing anything that "requires" safety glasses Choose eyewear
according to your exposure to hazards from all activities and not just
your own protocols. Consider the following hazards and assess the eye
risks:

**Biological Hazards**

-   Any pathogenic or infectious organisms (BSL-2) should be handled
    > with eye protection as the eye is a possible route of infection.

-   Any biological organisms where there is a risk of aerosols being
    > produced or airborne contamination.

**Chemical Hazards**

-   Corrosives, flammables, anything that is an irritant to the eye or
    > could otherwise damage it should be considered hazardous.

-   Splashes can happen easily---is there risk of spillage or accidental
    > splashes in the protocol?

**Physical Hazards**

-   Working with materials or equipment under stress, pressure,
    > spinning, mechanical force, or force that might cause
    > fragmentation or flying particles

-   Creating dust or fumes

-   Working with thermal hazards or heating sources (e.g., a Bunsen
    > burner)

-   Exposure to ultraviolet (e.g., use of UV light boxes for imaging
    > gels)

-   Cryogenic exposure, e.g., dispensing liquid nitrogen and liquid
    > helium or removing biological samples from liquid nitrogen storage
    > (large pressures can build up inside this closed system)

Daniel Kuespert at Johns Hopkins provides a useful algorithm for
deciding whether you need safety eyewear:

1.  Is the work you're about to do hazardous?\
    > If **YES**, wear appropriate eyewear. Obviously, you personally
    > need it.

2.  Is anyone else in the lab doing hazardous work?\
    > If **YES**, wear appropriate eyewear. You are exposed to their
    > hazards.

3.  Are chemicals or compressed gases stored or used in the lab at any
    > time?\
    > If **YES**, wear appropriate eyewear. You do not have control over
    > falling chemical bottles, poorly secured pressurized parts, etc.

4.  Is it possible anyone else will bring hazardous work into the lab
    > while you are there?\
    > If **YES**, wear appropriate eyewear. Somebody can walk in and
    > drop a chemical bottle at any time, so you need to be ready.

5.  Is it possible that you will "forget" to put on your eyewear if you
    > decide to do hazardous work---or simply not do it because "you're
    > just doing one little thing?"\
    > If **YES**, wear appropriate eyewear.

6.  Are you sure you won't do anything hazardous in lab today, no one
    > will walk in with hazardous materials or equipment, nothing
    > hazardous is stored in the lab, and you want to exhibit bad
    > professional habits?\
    > If **YES**, you **DON'T** need to wear safety eyewear.

### Types of Eye Protection

Eye protection should be chosen according to the risks you need to
mitigate. Below are the different types of eyewear to consider. Here are

### People Who Wear Spectacles or Contact Lenses

Glasses-wearers will need to use over-glasses or prescription safety
glasses if safety glasses are required. Spectacles do not provide the
same level of protection as they are not designed to prevent splashes or
projectiles entering the eye.

Contact lenses are not eye protective devices and can be hazardous in
some environments and degrade under specific volatile chemicals.
However, NIOSH and OSHA have both released statements supporting the
safe use of contacts within chemical environments. Regulations can vary
by lab and members should be aware of policies regarding contact lenses.
Contact lens wearers should wear eye protection in the same way as
anyone else!

### Overcoming Excuses Not to Wear Safety Glasses

As a community lab member or safety manager you may be confronted with
situations where people are not wearing safety glasses for procedures
where the risk assessment has found them necessary.

  **Excuse**                          **Response**
  ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  They keep fogging up                Anti-fog glasses are available, as are wipes that protect against fogging.
  I'm already wearing glasses         Normal spectacles offer limited protection from splashes as they are not designed for that purpose, e.g., splashes can enter from the top, bottom, and sides of most spectacle designs.
  I'm using a fume hood               Fume hoods are designed to protect the user from hazardous fumes and while the sash offers some protection, eye protection should also be worn.
  I haven't started my protocol yet   Hazards occur when setting up and tidying up so safety glasses should be worn for all activities and only taken off immediately before leaving the lab. Accidents often occur while moving stock bottles and other preparatory activities.

### Maintenance

All forms of safety eyewear you provide in your community lab need to
maintain good vision, including on the periphery of sight, should be
lightweight and comfortable in addition to providing protection from
relevant hazards---otherwise members will not wear it. You should
consider features like anti-scratch, anti-fog, and anti-glare coatings
which will improve function and reduce maintenance or replacement. Make
sure to clean your safety eyewear regularly.

| A research technician at a cancer research center was cutting a band |
| of purified DNA from an agarose gel on a UV light box. No one else   |
| in the lab wore UV-protective visors or other eye protection so      |
| neither did she. After cutting out the band she went on with her     |
| work and headed for a Friday night gig with her boyfriend. Her eyes  |
| became progressively worse until \"it felt as though there were 100  |
| eyelashes in my eye\". A trip to the emergency department revealed   |
| she had been burned by UV light exposure. Luckily she recovered full |
| over the weekend, but it was a close call and only after returning   |
| to the lab did she realize that all of the other researchers in the  |
| lab happened to wear spectacles which had been offering them partial |
| protection from the UV radiation. The lab immediately purchased two  |
| UV face shields (source:                                             |

Gloves
------

Appropriate gloves should be worn when handling biological or chemical
substances that may be absorbed through the skin or that are corrosive,
harmful, irritating, or otherwise damaging to the skin.

The main issues to consider are:

-   What gloves to wear

-   How to remove gloves safely (to prevent potential
    > cross-contamination)

### Deciding What Gloves to Wear 

Gloves should be selected on the basis of their intended use. Glove
manufacturers usually produce helpful charts to show how well their
gloves perform against different substances. These charts use three key
terms:breakthrough time, permeation rate, and degradation.

-   **Breakthrough time:** The time a chemical takes to permeate the
    > glove material and reach the inside. Permeation is a process by
    > which a chemical can pass through a material without going through
    > pinholes or pores or other visible openings. This tells you for
    > how long you can use a glove.

-   **Permeation rate**: The rate at which the chemical will move
    > through the material. The higher the rate the more of the chemical
    > will move through the glove. Choose a low rate.

-   **Degradation:** Degradation indicates the deterioration of the
    > glove material on contact with a specific chemical. Some chemicals
    > can destroy the glove material. It may get harder, softer, or may
    > swell. Choose gloves with an excellent or good degradation rating.

The performance of glove materials can vary slightly from manufacturer
to manufacturer, so base your selection on the correct manufacturers'
data and bear in mind that the manufacturers' data is for pure
chemicals, not mixtures. When you mix chemicals, their properties can
change. As a basic rule, base your glove selection on the components in
the mixture with the shortest breakthrough time. However, the only way
to be absolutely sure that a glove performs well against the mixture is
to have it tested.

### Chemical Safety and Gloves

No glove can protect you from all chemicals, and all gloves are
permeable to an extent. Moreover, using the wrong gloves can increase
chemical contact. Once you plan your experiment, consult a Glove
Reference Chart provided by a reputable manufacturer---preferably check
more than one and look for breakthrough times. Also look out for lab
standards when purchasing gloves, e.g., [[European Standard EN
374-3]{.ul}](https://www.safetygloves.co.uk/blog/a-guide-to-glove-safety-en374.html)
or [[ASTM F739-12]{.ul}](https://www.astm.org/Standards/F739.htm)
indicate gloves that are resistant to chemicals and different levels are
awarded depending on breakthrough time from 10 min to 4 hours.

For example, even though nitrile gloves are ubiquitous in most
laboratories, here are a few common lab chemicals you may encounter that
are NOT compatible with nitrile gloves:

-   Acetone and acetonitrile: like many other highly volatile solvents
    > (e.g., for use in HPLC), these will melt your nitrile glove
    > instantly! Use butyl gloves instead.

-   Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): will permeate nitrile gloves very rapidly
    > (and create a garlic-like taste in the mouth). Although DMSO
    > itself is nontoxic, it can carry other toxins into your skin. Use
    > neoprene or butyl gloves instead.

-   Phenol/chloroform (Trizol): This combination is notoriously
    > incompatible with most types of gloves---avoid if at all possible
    > as there are better alternatives available. See [[Chapter 10 -
    > Chemical
    > Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit#).

### Gloves for Biological Work

Nitrile gloves are a good option for most biological work and widely
available from medical suppliers. However, many medical grade gloves are
not recommended for use in labs because they are intended for very
shortiterm wear (e.g., a medical examination of a single patient),
rather than extended periods. Look for lab standards such as [[European
Standard EN
374-2]{.ul}](https://www.en-standard.eu/bs-en-374-2-2014-protective-gloves-against-dangerous-chemicals-and-microorganisms-determination-of-resistance-to-penetration/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm8Sxmsbd5QIVOINaBR3e-gtPEAMYASAAEgIinvD_BwE)
or [[ASTM]{.ul}](https://compass.astm.org/EDIT/html_annot.cgi?D6319).
This indicates gloves that are micro-organism resistant and act as an
effective barrier against microorganisms and the liquids they live in.

If a biological material, such as DNA, is being prepared in
phenol/chloroform, nitrile gloves are not suitable as they are not
resistant to either chemical. Neoprene is preferred.

In summary, always check the compatibility of chemicals in your protocol
with your chosen gloves! Chemical resistance should generally take
precedence over biological protection as chemically impermeable gloves
will often be impermeable to most biological organisms.

However, if you work with viruses, you may need virus specific gloves.
ISO 16604:2004 and ASTM F1671-97b (Standard Test Method for Resistance
of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Blood-borne
Pathogens using Phi-X174 Bacteriophage Penetration as a Test System) are
globally recognized test standards for glove resistance to penetration
by viruses.

### Latex and Allergies

In most cases we recommend against the use of latex gloves. In the U.S.,
8-17 percent of healthcare workers who regularly use latex gloves
develop allergies to proteins in the latex. This can result in a range
of symptoms from dermatitis to serious breathing problems and
anaphylactic shock, according to
[[AAFA]{.ul}](https://www.aafa.org/latex-allergy/). If you do buy latex
gloves ensure they are low-protein and powder free.

Be allergy aware with all types of gloves. If a lab member develops
rashes or skin problems you may need to try different materials. For
example, some people develop allergies to the accelerant used in
manufacturing in nitrile gloves. Accelerant-free versions are available.

If a lab member has reported a new or existing allergy, particularly
with serious symptoms then the safest response is to switch the lab away
from that type of glove entirely to avoid unintentional contact with the
allergen. Work with the member to find a safe way forward.

### General Tips for Gloves

1.  Select gloves of the correct size; gloves that are too small can be
    > uncomfortable and may tear. Oversized gloves may interfere with
    > manual dexterity.

2.  Longer sleeved gloves should be worn if the wrists and arms are also
    > at risk of contact with the substance.

3.  Gloves should be checked before use for punctures, tears, etc. and
    > should be replaced periodically.

4.  Some gloves, especially lightweight disposables, may be flammable.
    > Keep hands away from naked flames or other high temperature heat
    > sources.

5.  When removing gloves, do so in a way that avoids skin contact with
    > contaminated parts (see [[Removing Gloves
    > Safely]{.ul}](#removing-gloves-safely)).

6.  Do not wear gloves outside the lab.

7.  Do not touch items with gloves that are likely to be touched by
    > ungloved hands like door handles and telephones.

8.  Disposable single-use gloves must not be reused.

9.  Consider cuff length. Some hazards will require a longer cuff length
    > to protect both the hand and forearm to prevent liquids seeping
    > into gloves. A longer cuff length needs to be considered if large
    > volumes are being used or if hands are required to be immersed in
    > liquids.

10. Consider the duration and nature of contact. Tasks that require
    > hands to be immersed in liquids will need a higher level of
    > protection than ones where only splash protection is required.
    > Tasks where the user is exposed to extreme temperatures will also
    > need a higher level of protection. Consider the amount of contact
    > time with the hazards (e.g., occasional contact, continuous
    > immersion of hands, or continual contact).

11. Do not blow into gloves prior to putting them on; you risk
    > contaminating the gloves, as well as compromising their integrity.

### Removing Gloves Safely

Gloves should be removed using the 'surgical technique' to avoid
contamination of hands (see this
[[video]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/videos/gloves/removegloves.htm)
for a demonstration and the
[[poster]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/skin/posters/singleusegloves.pdf)
below). Many people have their own individual ways of removing gloves
that are just as effective. A good way to train people and confirm they
can successfully remove gloves without contamination is to get them to
cover the gloves they are wearing with cream that glows under UV light
(e.g., [[GloGerm]{.ul}](https://www.glogerm.com/)) and inspect their
skin under a blacklight after they have removed the gloves. Remember to
check the arm and the surrounding clothing and surfaces for splashes.

![](media/image74.jpg){width="6.5in" height="8.097222222222221in"}

### Hand Care

Gloves are not a substitute for hand washing and good hand care. All
labs should have dedicated hand-washing facilities with soap and paper
towels. While undertaking chemical and biological operations, the hands
should be washed:

-   Regularly

-   Immediately if contaminated by a chemical

-   Always before leaving the lab

-   Before and after using the toilet

Also consider providing hand cream or moisturiser. Dry skin is more
prone to infection and more permeable to chemicals. Laboratory members
with skin conditions that increase the permeability of the skin such as
psoriasis or eczema may need to use a higher level of protection when
working with hazardous chemicals. Consider using butyl rubber or
neoprene gloves.

Thermal Protection (Hot and Cold)
---------------------------------

There are times in the lab when hot and cold temperatures will require
specific protection.

### Hot Temperatures

Heat-resistant gloves should be used when unloading an autoclave and
handling glass bottles or plastic tubes from microwaves and hot plates.
These are typically worn over disposable gloves and should be heat
resistant but also have good grip. Gloves with mid-arm or longer
protection should be selected for transferring hot liquids between
containers. Take care to avoid heat-resistant gloves that are wet as it
may make the container slippery or transmit heat more readily.

Materials such as leather, Nomex, and silicone can be used. Always
consider grip and dexterity. Some gloves come with rubber and silicone
grips and are available as "mitts," but five-fingered gloves are
preferable as they improve dexterity.

### Cold Temperatures

Cold-resistant gloves are insulated gloves to prevent burns from extreme
cold temperatures when retrieving samples from ultra low temperature
freezers (-80°C) or handling cryogens. They have different properties
from gloves designed for hot temperatures. For handling cryogens, gloves
specifically designed for cryogen handling reach at least mid-way up the
arms. Note that many cryogen gloves are not rated for submersion into
the liquid nitrogen itself. If you need to retrieve something dropped
into liquid nitrogen use a tool and not your gloved hands.

Masks and Respirators
---------------------

Respiratory protective equipment (RPE) should only be used when toxic
gases, hazardous volatiles, or dusts are being generated and cannot be
contained by an engineering control such as a glove box, fume cupboard,
or other well-ventilated area/apparatus. Engineering controls should be
used whenever possible.

We recommend that community labs do not undertake work requiring masks
or respirators because other people in the area will still be exposed to
the hazard and there is a high training, testing, and maintenance burden
to ensure the equipment is functional. In addition, where equipment
relies on a tight fit to the face, it is recommended (and in some
jurisdictions required) that wearers and masks are tested for individual
face-fit.

Decisions should be made according to the risk assessment and in some
cases RPE is a good protective measure.

Hearing Protection
------------------

Some lab equipment makes a loud noise, for example sonicators use
ultrasonic sound energy to disrupt biological samples. The best course
of action is always to find an alternative that does not produce the
hazard. Mechanical disruptors such as bead beaters are typically quieter
and do not require hearing protection. If experiment or technical
requirements for the task do make loud noise, the next step is to
introduce engineering controls such as putting the equipment in a
separate room and/or in an enclosed sound-proofing box. If there is no
option but to have the operator or other members of the lab exposed to
the noise, then hearing protection will be required.

### How Loud Is Loud?

Any uncomfortably loud noises should be assessed and hearing protection
considered. Typically exposure above 80-90 dB averaged over an 8 hour
work day is the level where regulations require protection to be
provided (US OSHA regulation = 90 dB, EU Noise at Work
[[Regulations]{.ul}](https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/82)
= 80 dB, check your local regulator!). This is about the equivalent of a
power mower, heavy traffic, a blender or a hand saw. The averaging
process is complicated because dB is a logarithmic measure so a small dB
increase means a large reduction in the safe time limit. For example, a
one hour exposure to 90 dB is equivalent to more than eight hours
exposure to 80 dB.

If you're not sure how loud your equipment is, you can ask the
manufacturer, use a decibel measuring app on your phone/laptop, or find
someone with a professional device to perform a measurement.

The type of sound also makes a difference as hearing protection is
typically good at blocking high frequency sounds but functions poorly at
low frequencies. Luckily, low frequencies are less likely to be
encountered in a community lab.

### Type of Hearing PPE

Ear protection should dampen the sound reaching the operator's ear drum
to below 85 dB. For environments like community labs where the noise
hazard is likely to be present for only a short time, ear muffs may be
the most convenient form of protection, but it's important to offer a
choice so people can select a protector that fits them and is
comfortable. Remember that everyone exposed to the noise should wear
them, not just the operator of the machine.

You should consult the manufacturer's guidance and the level of noise
you are trying to reduce for the appropriate protection. You don't want
to overshoot and destroy audibility of all sounds such as alarms, which
can be dangerous and deter people from wearing the protection in the
first place.

In general, try not to reduce the audible noise to below 70 dB. Low
attenuation versions of ear protectors are available and while unlikely
to be relevant in community labs, protectors can also feature sound
restoration.

Each type of hearing PPE will typically come with a Single Number Rating
(SNR) that provides an estimate of the noise protection offered under
ideal use of the device.There is guidance available from the [[UK
HSE]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/noise/calculator.htm) on SNR ratings to
look for and a calculator for noise exposure and protection.

  Pre-molded ear plugs          Come in different sizes and shapes to fit different sized ear canals. Obtaining a good seal with the ear canal may be challenging because they do not expand or contract. Not recommended for community labs due to the need to know people's sizes.
  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Formable or foam ear plugs    These plugs expand to fill and seal the ear canal thus fitting different sizes. Need to be compressed and rolled prior to insertion and should be inserted with clean hands so hand washing facilities should be available. Training should be provided in how to insert them properly because an incorrectly compressed earplug may give virtually no protection.
  Ear muffs                     Fit against the head and enclose the entire ear. The inside of the cup is lined with acoustic foam to reduce noise. Their effectiveness depends on the seal between the foam and the head. Should be inspected frequently and before use to check for damage and cleaned regularly.
  Hearing bands or canal caps   These devices cover the ear canal at its opening. They do not provide as much of a seal inside the ear canal and generally provide less protection than ear muffs or plugs, so they are typically not recommended.

### Maintenance

You will need to make sure that hearing protection works effectively and
check that:

-   It is in good condition

-   Seals are undamaged on ear muffs

-   It is clean

-   Headbands are not damaged

-   Compressible earplugs are still soft, pliable, and clean (if reused)

### Training

Badly fitted ear plugs or ear muffs worn inappropriately will offer very
little protection. For compressible ear plugs, the following procedure
should be followed:

![](media/image65.jpg){width="6.5in" height="6.302083333333333in"}

Video:
[[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1840.html]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1840.html)

For ear muffs, the main concern is maintaining a tight seal to the head
so they should not be worn over other clothing or PPE, e.g., hats or
face visors that might get in the way. In these cases consider ear
plugs.

Protective Clothing Outside the Lab
-----------------------------------

The improper use or lack of protective clothing and equipment in a
laboratory can lead to chemical burns, biological exposures, or other
potential dangers. To help reduce the risk of exposure, personnel are
encouraged to wear gloves, safety glasses, lab coats, and other personal
protective clothing. However, in public areas, such as hallways and
lounges, wearing personal protective clothing and equipment is not
recommended. This is because contaminated clothing may present a hazard,
and the perception of contaminated protective clothing and equipment in
a public area may project a careless image to both colleagues and
visitors.

Wearing gloves outside the laboratory should be minimized, except to
move hazardous materials between laboratories. Chemicals should be
transported from place to place on a cart, in a clean secondary
container, or in a bottle carrier with secure handles. When this is not
an option, personnel should use a clean, ungloved hand to touch common
surfaces and a gloved hand to carry the items: the one-glove rule.
Alternatively, the material should be packaged so the outer container
may be transported without the need for PPE.

Protective gloves should never come into contact with door handles,
elevator buttons, telephones, lavatory faucets, vending machines,
bottled water dispensers, ice-making machines, or other surfaces outside
the laboratory. Also, please be aware that strict federal and state
regulations address the transport of hazardous (e.g., biological,
chemical, radiological) materials on public roads.

For the sake of safety, appearances, and courtesy, personnel are asked
not to wear contaminated, stained, or potentially contaminated lab coats
and other research clothing and equipment in any public area, especially
dining areas, lounges, auditoriums, conference rooms, or other
non-hazardous areas.

If you're undertaking activities "in the field" or transporting heavy
items to and from the lab you might also want to consider protective
clothing. Field work might require specific PPE equipment for the task,
which should be addressed during the risk assessment. An [[example
guide]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=147cOeOKtQ6LzGAKlnQh-E-zepgwkW4vK)
to aid in planning your field activities was made by James Madison
University. For example:

-   Steel toe-capped boots if carrying heavy pieces of lab equipment
    > that could be dropped

-   Waterproof and warm clothing if performing field-work in cold and
    > wet conditions

-   Sunhats and sunglasses if performing field-work in hot conditions;
    > sunblock or sun protective clothing

-   Communication devices (or emergency contacts), radios, or GPS.

-   Emergency fall harnesses, protective knee or elbow pads

-   First aid kits, water

Medical Surveillance 
--------------------

Take medical conditions and pregnancy into account when assessing risk
for participation in activities and protocols. For example, the use of
mutagens and teratogens should be especially avoided by pregnant women;
immuno-compromised members may not be able to work with particular
microorganisms without enhanced PPE or containment measures; and certain
skin conditions make the skin more permeable to chemicals and therefore
also require enhanced PPE.

Ensure that you have processes in place to collect relevant health
information from participants in your activities and make decisions
based on that information, but be sure to keep that information
protected and private.

9 . Equipment Usage and Safety 
==============================

General Equipment Safety 
------------------------

Scientific environments often carry risk that is unforeseeable as the
nature of the work is to test or try things that have never been done
before. Often this type of work requires processes using high energy
such as mechanical, sonic, electrical, electromagnetic, high stress, and
high or low temperatures. These conditions can combine to increase the
potential harm that can come from equipment failure.

We suggest checking equipment safety features, tolerances, and
guidelines when assessing risk. We also suggest multiple methods and
failsafes to prevent accidents and to limit harm if failures do indeed
occur.

Specific Concerns for Typical Lab Equipment
-------------------------------------------

We recommend having manuals for all of your lab equipment readily
available to users of the lab and providing training for the first time
use of any lab equipment. Below are some typical safety issues that one
should be aware of when using common lab equipment.

**Autoclaves:** Autoclaves use very high pressure and temperature.
Appropriate PPE should be worn when operating an autoclave. The door
gasket (seal) should be checked for cracks, and the drain screen should
be free of debris. Ensure the door is closed properly before starting a
run, and never attempt to open an autoclave door during a run. For more
information on autoclaving practices and how to test and verify an
autoclave from the CDC, see
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/autoclave-safety.pdf)
and
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/sterilizing-practices.htm).
We recommend that all users are trained, that autoclaves are regularly
inspected and serviced by a professional and that the lab has a plan in
place for validation of effective functioning and biological
inactivation. Note that in some countries (such as the UK) autoclaves
fall under pressure vessel regulations and there are legal requirements
regarding insurance and inspections.

**Anaerobic chambers:** Anaerobic chambers operate under pressure so the
major failure points are seals leaking, failure of the pressure
regulator on the CO~2~ tank or chamber, or pressure sensor failure.
Failures could lead to breaches of containments and unintended exposure
of the user to the organism they are using. We recommend that all users
are trained and that anaerobic chambers are regularly inspected and
serviced by a professional.

**Bioreactors/ fermenters\*:** The temperature control and electrical
and fluidic connections can all fail leading to electrical or biological
hazards. Connections for pressure regulators and pumps could also cause
an issue. The main risk here is that a spill of biological material
could be much larger from a bioreactor than from a dropped flask or
other incident. Build your biological spill plan (See [[Chapter
13]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit))
bearing in mind the largest volume that will be cultured in the lab.

**Biosafety cabinets (BSCs) and laminar flow cabinets:** Clogged or
ineffective filters and contaminated casing or pan can all cause
contamination of your biological materials and potential exposure of
users. Air pressure failures and poor working practice can also cause
issues. As BSCs are one of the larger and heavier items of lab
equipment, we recommend that you consider installing a sash counter
weight and a stable base to ensure that the BSC is properly seated and
secured to the wall. See the [[Hood]{.ul}](#in-depth-hoods) section
below for more details. We recommend that all users are trained and that
BSCs are regularly inspected and serviced by a professional.

**Centrifuges**: One of the biggest problems with centrifuges is an
unbalanced rotor, which can loosen and put strain on the spindle. With
time this can cause the centrifuge to start moving unstably while
spinning---in the worst cases, it can move across the work surface and
potentially fall off. Eventually the spindle can shear. This will
irreparably damage the equipment and in larger, high-speed centrifuges
can also cause damage to surrounding areas and injure people. Always
ensure that samples are placed properly balanced within the centrifuge
before a run. Other issues to pay attention to include: spindle cracks
or chips, unclean rotors, loose particles in the chamber, lid fitting on
the rotor securely, speed sensor, and brake working properly. Your
biological spill plan (see [[Chapter
13]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit)
- ) should cover what to do if a centrifuge or the samples inside it
break. We recommend that all users are trained and that centrifuges are
inspected and serviced by a professional if they show any signs of wear
or damage and ideally preventatively serviced on a regular basis.

**Chemical fume hoods:** It is very important that fume hoods are
operating effectively to protect the user and lab from exposure to
hazardous chemicals. You should check that the blower is exhausting
properly and is able to pull the proper pressure at the indicated sash
height. Also, you should check that all the mechanical parts of the
cabinet are functional, e.g., the vents in the rear are opening and
closing, sash counter weight is moving smoothly, and the sash is able to
close. You should also ensure users are able to close all ports, gas,
vacuum, and air water lines coming into the hood. We recommend that all
users are trained and that fume hoods are regularly inspected and
serviced by a professional.

**Flow cytometers**: Common problems are leaks, electrical shorts, and
puddling fluids. As the device contains powerful lasers, you should also
have laser power safety shields and ensure that the laser power and
shutters are working. Your biological spill plan (see [[Chapter 13 -
Biological
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit))
should cover what to do if a spill occurs inside or on the flow
cytometer.

**Freezers**: Issues include condenser pans leaking on electronics,
unleveled units which are at risk of tipping over, and compressors
overheating. Freezer failures can also be devastating and very expensive
for projects and members, damaging precious samples and reagents. Fit
freezer alarms if possible and ensure members are in the habit of
checking freezer function and looking out for telltale signs of water on
the floor. There are many commercial options and also many DIY designs
out there using Arduino or Raspberry Pi (e.g.,
[[here]{.ul}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2014/04/18/build-a-fridgefreezer-temperature-alarm-using-your-raspberry-pi-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/)
and
[[here]{.ul}](https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/09/19/arduino-freezer-temperature-alarm-arduinomonday/))
that your members might be able to construct. Use of ultralow
temperature freezers (-80°C) and cryogen equipment brings its own safety
issues and users should be provided with appropriate PPE to avoid
cryogenic burns (see Chapter 6).

**Gel electrophoresis:** The main issue with gel electrophoresis is that
it operates at a high voltage and requires protection measures to avoid
exposing the user to unprotected terminals or exposed wiring or the
buffer while the gel is running. The shock is likely to be painful and
for someone with a heart condition it could cause worse problems. Always
check for leakages or spilled buffer, frayed wiring, or exposed
contacts. Ensure that the equipment is labeled as high voltage and
immediately taken out of service if anything is broken.

**Glassware/distillation columns:** Glassware can have sharp edges
causing risks of injury, brittle connections causing failures and
cracks, and seal leaks, resulting in chemical or biological
contamination. Ensure that members are aware to check the glassware they
are using and know what to do with any that is chipped or broken.

**Glove boxes:** Breaches of containment and exposure of users to the
biological material being manipulated is the most significant safety
hazard. This can be due to failure of seals, air leaks (you can check
with soapy water bubbles = leak), and brittle plastic. We recommend that
all users are trained and that glove boxes are regularly inspected and
serviced by a professional.

**Heat blocks:** These can have temperature regulator problems and
electrical problems as well as providing a hot surface with risk of
burns. Ensure there is a thermometer available to check against the
reported temperature and do not allow overnight use.

**Microscopes (with or without lasers):** The most common issue in all
microscopes is electrical problems and hot surfaces where dust can
accumulate causing a fire risk. Many also have moving stages resulting
in mechanical pinch points where users can trap fingers and use of glass
slides can sharp edges. Fluorescent microscopes also result in laser
safety problems. We recommend that all users of microscopes with lasers
are trained.

**Microwaves:** Microwaves run at a high voltage and produce microwave
radiation so proper shielding is important. Make sure that the shielding
on the door is intact and the safety interlock is functioning
correctly---he microwave should not run with the door open.

**PCR machines:** Thermocyclers get hot and also sometimes have
electrical problems. Some additionally have heads that slide on and off
the device and lids that can be tightened on top of tubes, resulting in
mechanical pinch points that could cause injury.

**Pipettes**: Pipettes should be regularly calibrated and cleaned.
Improper use can lead to contamination and occasionally lead to failed
experiments. Pipettes, especially with a tip on, can be sharp, and
should be used with care.

**Sonicators and blenders:** Sonicators create a very loud ultra sound
noise which requires ear protection for users and those in surrounding
areas during use. This means that they should ideally be located in a
separate room with a sign to prevent people entering without ear
protection while the device is on. Alternatively, all users of the lab
should be provided with hearing protection. Blenders specifically can
have sharp blades and moving parts that can cause injury.

**Sterilizers, steam-pressurized vessels**: This equipment is a heat
source and hot surfaces should be labeled to alert users. Emergency
valves should be fitted and functional to avoid over-pressure operation
and the rapid release of steam and pressure that could damage the
equipment and injure users. All users should be trained and provided
with appropriate PPE to avoid scalds or burns.

**Stomachers:** Mechanical pinch points/sharp edges, electrical safety.

**Soldering iron**: Soldering irons are very hot---usually around 350°C.
Hot objects are a fire risk so ensure that good quality holders for
soldering irons are provided and that people know to check they have
switched off the iron before they leave. You can add timers to solder
iron plugs to avoid issues with them accidentally being left on. Avoid
using lead-based solder, especially when working with kids! Electrical
safety is also important and users should look out for frayed cords.

**UV transilluminator**: UV light can be hazardous to the skin and eye.
Never use a transilluminator without the proper protective panel or face
and arm protection.The electrical connections need to be sealed from wet
conditions such as electrophoresis buffer dripping from gels.

**Pumps and vacuums:** Electrical problems, mechanical pinch
points/sharp edges, high pressure or safety, compressed gas or high
vacuum explosion.

In Depth: Hoods
---------------

Many labs have hoods such as biosafety cabinets, laminar flow hoods, or
chemical fume hoods. Understanding how each of them is different, what
they do/don't protect against, and how to safely use them is very
important. More information on the safe use of chemical fume hoods can
be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://documents.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@sci/@chem/documents/doc/uow059174.pdf);

Electrical Safety 
-----------------

Electrical safety is a major concern with any piece of equipment. All
equipment should be properly grounded and fused. All devices need to
pass electrical tests and standards to be commercially sold. We
recommend continuing to maintain these standards in repairs or upgrades.

Electrical protections (e.g., ground fault circuit interrupter and
breaker fuses) should meet local building codes. This insures that the
equipment will not become more dangerous nor will the connection to the
equipment become a safety issue during operation. This will protect
yourself and others during a power spike or accident.

Risks in Acquiring Used Equipment and Donations
-----------------------------------------------

When acquiring equipment there can be inherent problems that go above
and beyond "does it work". Listed below are some of the common problems.

-   **Form**: The form of the material can have micro cracks, chips, or
    > stress fractures, e.g., a stressed spindle in a centrifuge.

-   **Function**: Because scientific equipment is precision engineered,
    > slight changes in the function could cause dangerous conditions,
    > e.g., unbalanced rotors on centrifuges, motor controls, safety
    > relief valves, fuses.

-   **Materials**: Compatible materials could cause issues with, UV or
    > chemical damage, aging could affect the useable lifetime.

-   **Strength**: ging and wear and tear can affect the strength of
    > materials resulting in failures.

-   **Contamination**: chemical or biological materials could be inside
    > the equipment that requires clean up. Chemicals could react with
    > residue on the equipment that could result in fumes. Furthermore,
    > donated equipment could contain radioactive materials that have
    > not been mitigated.

Here is an example of risks that might not be apparent. During one of
BioCurious's community projects, we were testing a light source and it
had not been used in a long time. Dust had settled on the bulb when we
turned it on. It started to burn off the dust which caused a little
alarm because we didn't know what was burning.

Another common example of risk is glassware that is unwashed. These
could contain toxic chemicals, or trace amounts that could react with
the growth of cultures. Worse yet chemical residue can cause reactions
to take place that could produce toxic gases or fires (this has happened
at many labs). Furthermore, if the donation was involved in bacterial
growth from a BSL-2 lab due to unsterilized glassware. Phage residue has
been known to contaminate a lab, which has caused reproducibility
issues, inconsistent growth, or cultures crashing for "no explainable
cause." I cannot emphasize enough how difficult it is to get rid of a
phage infection once it takes hold.

**Some Countries Require a License for Specific Pieces of Equipment**

Check with your local laws to determine what specific equipment requires
a permit. Equipment may require a permit if it is a high potential
energy or uses chemicals that are controlled. For example, lasers, or
equipment that contains radioactive materials, such as air ionizers, may
also require a permit. Medical equipment is tightly regulated and
research that could appear as treatment could bring heavy fines even if
both parties consent. Export of equipment is also another area where you
need a permit and to pay export tax. Even hand carrying personal
equipment to other countries you intend to bring back can require
federal oversight.

Decontamination of Used Equipment 
---------------------------------

In principle, it is the donor's responsibility to clean and
decontaminate equipment they are providing, but in practice this often
does not happen and community labs end up with equipment that requires
decontamination. We always suggest asking what the equipment was used
with and around and then doing your own decontamination based on the
answers you obtain.

Typically, biological decontamination is performed with a compatible
reagent like 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, or others such as commercial lab
disinfectants. For chemical decontamination, usually water is used with
paper towels. In every case, we recommend researching the agents the
equipment was used with and finding the proper decontamination method.
In both cases, place these in the proper disposal containers. See
[[disinfection and their proper
use]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8)
in Working with Microbes and online guides to disinfection, e.g.,
[[Disinfection
101]{.ul}](http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Disinfection/Assets/Disinfection101.pdf)
from Iowa State University.

### Decontaminating a Biosafety Cabinet

Occasionally, community biology labs inherit or buy used biosafety
cabinets. It is very important that they be decontaminated before using
and that the HEPA filter is checked to see if it is still functioning,
particularly if you are unsure of the age or last date of service. If
the filter gets too loaded, it will not allow sufficient airflow to
maintain the containment barrier effectively.

See
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.asu.edu/ehs/documents/asu-bsc-decontamination.pdf)
for more info on how to surface decontaminate a cabinet. If you do need
to check and replace the HEPA filter, you will need to hire a hood
calibration and repair company who will decontaminate it prior to
accessing the filter using fumigation with vaporized formaldehyde or
hydrogen peroxide, with the latter being preferable as it is much safer.

### Decontaminating Donated Glassware

Glassware is a great resource for reusable, durable, chemically
resistant containers that can be heated and cooled---really the ideal
container for so much of the community lab's needs. Having good clean
glassware helps make working in the lab easier, cheaper, and less of a
hassle. Dirty glassware is often the cause of big problems in many labs:
trace detergents, trace minerals, or chemical residue can make
experiments unpredictable and unreliable. Therefore, we cannot stress
enough to make sure you are cleaning glassware correctly and often. As
always, select the proper PPE necessary to wash the dishes and protect
from sharp glass, use a hot water grip to deal with slippery glassware
as well as lab coat and eye protection for splashes in the eyes or
clothing.

Even new glassware should be thoroughly washed and rinsed. New glassware
is slightly basic and should be treated in a 1% hydrocloric acid soak
overnight to remove any residue from manufacturing. For any donated
glassware, we recommend knowing what kind of work was being performed in
the glassware and taking the appropriate steps to do a second
decontamination of the glassware. We recommend insisting all donated
glassware should be donated clean by the donor and a second cleaning
done in the community lab before use. Donated glassware may also require
an overnight bleach soak to decontaminate it. We do not recommend taking
any heavily stained glassware or glassware with chemical residue on it.

Many labs have a soaking protocol for different types of purposes, e.g.,
10% bleach soak to remove bacterial contamination or a weak acid soak to
remove calcium carbonate from hard water. We recommend using brushes or
sponges that can reach inside all areas of the glassware, be bent to
reach around the edges of openings, and whose bristles will not scratch
the container or degrade under mild acid or basic conditions. The method
of cleaning should depend on the end use of the glassware. The choice of
detergent will depend on your end use, but many general use detergents
are available. These lab specific detergents are formulated to rinse
cleanly off the glassware where many household soaps can leave a residue
(which when exposed to acid can result in a thin film of grease). Heavy
dirt, grit, or residue should be removed with a scraper. Bacterial
pellets or lysis residue can be a source of contamination and should be
scrubbed to make sure all of the greasy biofilm is removed prior to
washing. For some chemicals, a solvent step might be necessary. Extra
care should be taken if there is phage contamination, which is difficult
to remove from a lab environment once it becomes contaminated. Depending
on the purpose, washing can be done in tap water or filtered or treated
water. A final triple rinse should be with the same quality of water you
will be using in your experiments. Therefore, if you are making media
with high-quality 18 OHM water, you should be triple rinsing with 18 OHM
water as well. Depending on the purpose, after the final rinse glassware
may be autoclaved with loose lids or foil coverings to make the
container sterile for use. Often these are finished with a dry setting
to evaporate any condensed steam in the container.

**General Protocols for Washing Glassware**

-   Use the proper PPE for the washing task---gloves, lab coat, and eye
    > protection.

-   Fill the basin with warm water.

-   Add the recommended amount of soap to the basin for the amount of
    > water.

-   Add any bleach or dilute acid for a soak.

-   Dip the glassware in the wash basin.

-   Scrub with brush inside and outside.

-   Dip the glassware in the wash basin.

-   Scrub with brush inside and outside.

-   Rinse with water to remove soap.

-   Triple rinse with final quality water (triple rinse is described
    > as 1) rinsing the outside with water, filling to ⅓ height,
    > swirling, and inverting so water touches every part of the
    > inside; 2) rinsing the outside with water, filling to ⅓ height,
    > swirling, and inverting so water touches every part of the
    > inside; 3) rinsing the outside with water, filling to ⅓ height,
    > swirling, and inverting so water touches every part of inside.

We do not recommend the use of chromic acid in cleaning. The use of
chromic acid for most labs is not necessary, and this level of organic
material under specific organic chemistry conditions might warrant this
level of cleaning to avoid side reactions. The method is very corrosive.
It removes the corrodes on the glass surface and removes markings on the
glass. Several resources are available for more information. We do not
recommend this method for the community lab as the chemicals are
expensive, very corrosive, carcinogenic, and difficult to dispose of.

Radiation Safety Evaluation for Incoming Equipment
--------------------------------------------------

Some community labs have been offered or received donated equipment that
has been exposed to radioactive material. Sometimes the previous owner
viewed donation as an easy way to off-load the costly and difficult task
of arranging proper disposal because all the costs and risks are thus
passed to the community lab. This is not a problem you want to have so
take steps to mitigate the risk!

We recommend questioning donors about the previous use of the equipment
and the type of lab it was used in. Do not accept donations of equipment
that they confirm or you suspect has been exposed to radiation---watch
out for radioactive warning labels and bear in mind that sometimes
people peel them off. If you do end up with equipment in your lab about
which you have concerns, it is impossible to detect radiation and
confirm if there is an issue without a [[geiger
counter]{.ul}](https://orise.orau.gov/reacts/guide/detect.html). Contact
someone with access to and experience in using a calibrated geiger
counter to test the equipment. If it is radioactive, contact local
specialist disposal contractors to establish how to get rid of it and
anticipate that this could be expensive.

Making Your Own Equipment
-------------------------

Every piece of equipment once started as a prototype. As such, we
encourage community lab members to make equipment. But doing so comes
with risks both to the maker, users, and those around them. Commercial
equipment has passed through many iterations to ensure safety. This is
not the case with homemade equipment, and therefore additional
precautions should be made.

Ask questions about your systems, and do a design review while building
them. Discuss with people who know electronics, fluidics, and mechanical
controllers; they will tell you the risks and help prevent disaster.
There are many systems you can walk through to help in the design review
process to identify the risks.

A design review goes through every system to determine the possible
risks to failure. The most typical risks:

### Common Risks in Making Your Own Equipment

-   **Fire:** his includes hot surfaces, sparks, flammable gasses or
    > liquids

-   **Sonic: U**ltrasound, repeated exposure to loud sounds

-   **Spectral: T**his could be use of infrared or ultraviolet light as
    > well as high-intensity light either solar or lasers

-   **Electrical:** This includes high energy AC or DC but could be
    > charged capacitors, live wires, or insulation on wires' terminal
    > connections; frayed cords or plugs that do not fit the connections

-   **Mechanical:** echanical risks could include pinch points,
    > splinters, swinging arms, weight imbalance, mechanical parts
    > breaking loose under stress, sharp edges/points, loose fittings,
    > breaking parts trips, or falling equipment

-   **Cryogenic:** Use of dry Ice, liquid nitrogen, broken compressed
    > gas lines

-   **Pressure:** Compressed gases, compressed gas cylinders, pressured
    > lines, vessels under pressure

Design reviews can take a few different forms. We recommend doing what
is called a "what if" analysis. What if questions can step through all
of the connections and systems as parts or as a whole. Developing a good
list can help improve the design and make the user experience better as
well. You should look at it in the whole context of the instrument.

| Tailor these questions to your equipment and the subsystems you are  |
| reviewing. They will help you produce a risk assessment for the use  |
| of the equipment and help you prioritize critical safety features to |
| add and problems to solve (see [[How to do a Risk                    |
| Assessmen]{.ul}](https://docs.google.                                |
| com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/edit)t). |
| Below is an example table to copy---extend more blank rows and fill  |
| out. Here is a quick explanation on how to use it. The "What if"     |
| column is the question; the Answer column is the result if a problem |
| occurred. The Likelihood column is the possibility it could happen:  |
| 1 = unlikely; 5 i= very likely. The Consequences column is the       |
| severity iff the "what if" scenario occurred. For example, if the    |
| fuse trips or simple damage occurred, this might be a 1, but if      |
| death or injury occurred then this would be severe and should rank a |
| 5. Multiplying the numbers from the Likelihood and Consequences      |
| columns together would give the score. A higher score helps to       |
| determine risk and, therefore, what problem to solve first.          |
|                                                                      |

### Specific Concerns Making DIY Equipment

We have seen a lot of great DIY projects. In fact, there are whole
sections dedicated to the topic on
[[Instructables]{.ul}](https://www.instructables.com/), the [[NIH
website]{.ul}](https://3dprint.nih.gov/). Many of these pieces of
equipment can be found on Ebay or auction sites. We suggest finding used
equipment. We would rather have you focused on your experiments rather
than troubleshooting homemade equipment. We have also seen dangerous
mistakes, so here are several types of projects where we suggest
proceeding with caution.

### Electrical Ratings/DIY Power Supplies 

Electrical equipment should go through testing and certification through
FCC or UL ratings ([[UL in other
countries]{.ul}](https://marks.ul.com/about/ul-listing-and-classification-marks/appearance-and-significance/)).
These tests help provide a baseline for safe electrical safety and are
globally accepted standards. DIY equipment will not have been tested to
meet the regulations so it is best to over engineer safety into a piece
of equipment.

**Power Cords**

**Single phase and triple phase:** Some devices DIY labs are likely to
see require high voltage. For example, electron mircoscopes often
require very high voltage. Any equipment that has high temp, low
pressure, or is just generally older might require 208V, 230V, or 415V.
You can often see higher power ratings on large AC motors,e.g., in large
HVAC units and street or building lighting. Also, equipment might
require [[single or triple
phase]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quABfe4Ev3s). As the
voltage increases often the amperage also increases, which means that
all parts of the connection should be rated to continuously handle the
amount of electrical energy it is conducting. Often adequate concern is
not placed on the electrical power connections.

Power supplies are an essential part of the laboratory necessary for
various experiments. High voltage is necessary for many experiments.
However, several of the methods of making high voltage power supplies we
have seen are unsafe. These lack much of the basic safety features
fuses, grounding, and proper wire size to carry the voltage without
overheating or improper insulation of wires or terminals. We have seen
designs that include cases that have sharp corners, conductive
materials, and open access for small fingers. Power sources are really
not expensive and can be readily found on ebay and auctions.

Glove Boxes/Fume Hoods/Biosafety Cabinets
-----------------------------------------

The design of these instruments are modeled and simulated to carry the
air in specific patterns. Depending on the purpose, they include dead
air space or move air in specific directions. Some vent and some
recirculate the air. Some have specific filter designs or
configurations. They are not interchangeable, and conversions from one
type to another could upset the airflow balance or allow chemicals or
bacteria to accumulate in areas. The materials, paint, glass, hinges,
and ports are selected for a reason. Some are designed to be easily
cleaned and reassembled. Ports on a chemical hood might allow air in and
be part of the design. There also might be a drain in the fume hood
which would not be ideal for a conversion to a biosafety cabinet. Making
your own version of these might leave pockets of dead air or air flow
imbalance leaving condensed chemicals in pockets or mold to grow on dust
sporulate. Also, understanding manufacturing defects could be impossible
because this is a custom device, with inconsistent seams, seam closure,
materials, filter designs, and material breakdown lifetime. For example,
a biosafety cabinet is designed for pulling in a sterile curtain of air
around the sample, but a cabinet is also designed for cleaning up
spills, handling liquids, and to have no areas where bacteria can grow.
The whole insides are resistant to the typically cleaning agents and
easily removable; edges are rounded for ease of cleaning. Many of the
features of these hoods like those noted above in the biosafety cabinet
example were discovered by trial and error, evidence from past designs
and failures. A DIY version of this would suffer from a design of one
with no legacy of trial and error.

DIY Laminar Flow or "Dead Air" Box for Plant and Mushroom Culturing
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For work that requires sterility but poses no contamination risk to the
user, if the lab does not have a biosafety cabinet available it can be
useful to build a simple laminar flow bench, consisting of a blower that
pushes HEPA-filtered air over the cultures and towards the user. The DIY
mushroom grower community has developed a number of pages with good
instructions for how to build such a design:

-   [[http://www.fungifun.org/English/Flowhood]{.ul}](http://www.fungifun.org/English/Flowhood)

-   [[http://www.sporetradingpost.com/building_a\_professional_flowhood.htm]{.ul}](http://www.sporetradingpost.com/building_a_professional_flowhood.htm)

-   [[https://mycotek.org/index.php?threads/49/]{.ul}](https://mycotek.org/index.php?threads/49/)

Clearly this setup does not protect the user from the cultures, but it
can be very effective in avoiding contamination of the cultures by the
user or the environment. Besides its use for mushroom and plant cell
culturing, a laminar flow can also be useful to pour Petri plates or
other experiments that require a contamination-free environment.

Avoid using mushroom spores in a laminar flow hood, as the spores will
be spread throughout the lab, and may cause mushroom allergies in your
lab mates. Likewise, never take any moldy material into a laminar flow
hood, because spreading mold spores throughout the lab can lead to
dangerous mold allergies and even fatal diseases such as aspergillosis!

A "dead air box" can occasionally be a good alternative to a laminar
flow hood. The goal of a dead air box is to reduce air circulation to a
minimum to avoid contamination with airborn spores. A DIY version can be
made by simply turning a plastic bin on its side and cutting a few arm
holes in the side. Optionally, some oversized long-sleeved cleaning
gloves could be attached to the openings to make a rudimentary glove
box.

As opposed to a laminar flow hood, a DIY glove box such as this could
offer some marginal protection to the user if used with great care.
However, they are more likely to provide a false sense of security and
should never be used in a BSL-2 for experiments that require a true
biosafety cabinet or glove box.

UV Transilluminators
--------------------

UV tables and transilluminators are used for visualization of UV
fluorescent molecules such as DNA or RNA after gel electrophoresis and
staining (e.g., ethidium bromide). UV light from these instruments is
harmful to the skin and can cause injury if exposed for a prolonged
period of time. Personnel operating these instruments must be protected
with appropriate protection equipment which includes, nitrile gloves,
lab coat, special compliant eyewear, screens, shields, and barriers.

UV instruments should be located in low-traffic areas of the lab and
users should be trained in using the equipment safely and minimize the
exposure to UV light. We recommend using blue light transilluminators in
place of the UV light source.

Transilluminators are a lab essential and a great item to make as a DIY
piece of equipment. There are many different designs for these. Some
considerations for making these are as follows. The instrument will get
wet; there will be voltage also so all precautions should be taken to
prevent the voltage mixing with the liquids. Science as a whole has
moved away from UV light stains like ethidium bromide to Blue light DNA
stains like sybr green. We recommend using Blue LEDs, blue light stains,
and waterproofing the box and electrical connections. Make sure the LED
arrays are properly protected from liquids and shorts. There are several
kits out there that allow liquids into the seams.

Centrifuges
-----------

We strongly recommend not making any DIY type of centrifuge. Even the
smallest centrifuges are dangerous and have hurt people. People take
them for granted because they are not large or very powerful; however,
they can still wrap around hair and climb up long hair and rip it from
the scalp. 3D printed rotors, buckets, or sample holders are not
suitable for any velocity or balance. Prints come with structural
defects because layers are not often bound to the layer above or below
and may have balance issues caused by inconsistent nozzle flow or infill
patterns or the design could print differently between machines on the
print bed where the supports are. These can mean catastrophic failure at
speed due to angular forces involved in centrifugation. Some of these
common designs border on the range of an ultracentrifuge without the
protective steel jacket or vacuum to lessen the drag and friction. The
dremelfuge is a good example of this. At full speed, the 2g tube could
be spinning at 50,000g, which would make the tube weigh 100kg. With no
protective cover, this becomes a projectile not to mention the danger
from touching the spinning mass or the connection to the motor which
could snap.

    > Rotor bursting steel jacket at about 40 seconds.

Centrifuges are getting less and less expensive and are commonly
available as used equipment. They include the safety interlocks fuses
and protection from a failure that many DIY designs do not.

Safety interlocks, fuses, power surges, and shorts can cause a
centrifuge to operate outside of their normal function. This will often
include unpredictable functions like a stuck lid interlock. Also, every
centrifuge produced has a safety interlock, and the manual also has
instructions on how to unlock the stuck lid. This does not include the
use of a crowbar! Often there is a plug over a lock release, which can
include a string to pull to release or a hole with release button that
can be pressed with a long thin hex wrench.

**10. Chemical Safety** 
=======================

**Introduction**
----------------

Chemical safety covers best practices for handling chemicals that may be
hazardous to users and the environment. We recommend that users
familiarize themselves with the chemicals used and the associated
hazards and regulations.

**Chemical Hazard Recognition and Labels**
------------------------------------------

Hazard symbols can differ by country and therefore can be confusing.
However, it is important to familiarize yourself with these Hazard
Communications (HAZCOM) pictograms or symbols for the safety of
personnel, the environment (including aquatic life, plants, and
animals), and legal compliance. Disregard for signage may have severe
civil and criminal penalties.

In general, we note several Hazard Communications (HAZCOM) symbols from
different agencies: United Nations Global Harmonized Systems (GHS),
National Fire Protection Agency **(**NFPA), U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT), and International Air Transport Association
(IATA). Most agencies, like IATA, are moving toward the GHS system.

Information about what signage means is widely distributed and freely
available on the web. It is best practice to read and understand local
regulations and talk to professionals (e.g., environmental health and
safety officers, local schools, or universities) about how best to
interpret signage and what signage you should be used in the lab.

**Chemical Safety Symbols: Global Harmonized System** 
-----------------------------------------------------

Global Harmonized System ([[GHS)
pictograms]{.ul}](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/chemical-safety/basics/ghs.html)
help to identify the danger of the chemical or substance. [[Hazard
Communications
(HAZCOM)]{.ul}](https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/pictograms.html)
pictograms are the most common symbols you will see on chemical
containers, manifests, paperwork (such as Safety Data Sheets), and
websites about the chemical. They are distinctive diamond shapes that
can be in multiple colors and include a number that is associated with
the severity of the danger with 1 being the most hazardous and 4 being
the least hazardous.

(Note that this is the opposite of the U.S. National Fire Protection
Association \[NFPA\] numbers, which state that 4 is the most hazardous
and 1 is the least hazardous.)

There has been a recent movement to simplify communications and safety
symbols around chemical safety. The goal is to help everyone, and
especially emergency responders, understand hazards that are encountered
and how to best be prepared for those hazards.

The United Nations (UN) has proposed moving to GHS for communicating
chemical safety. This was done to ease global trade and establish an
international standard for chemical safety. At this time, the GHS system
is implemented differently around the world, so it's important to
understand these regulatory differences.

The following pages show the graphics depicting the different types of
symbols and what they represent. More information can be found by
following the links.

**National Fire Protection Association Placards and the NFPA Diamond**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The National Fire Protection Agency
([[NFPA]{.ul}](https://www.nfpa.org/Assets/files/AboutTheCodes/704/NFPA704_HC2012_QCard.pdf))
evaluates and educates on best fire safety practices globally.
[[NFPA]{.ul}](https://www.nfpa.org/Assets/files/AboutTheCodes/704/NFPA704_HC2012_QCard.pdf)
policies in a particular country may be found by doing a local code
search on the NFPA website
([[https://codefinder.nfpa.org/]{.ul}](https://codefinder.nfpa.org/)).

The [[NFPA 704
diamond]{.ul}](https://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/aboutthecodes/704/704_faqs.pdf)
(pictured below) is typically found on buildings, but might be seen on
doors and large tanks. It is used to quickly identify the severity of
hazards in a location and inform users about any special hazards. They
are often seen accompanying a United Nations Global Harmonized System
(GHS) and Department of Transportation (DOT) placard with a hazard class
of the chemical. Some countries, such as
[[Australia]{.ul}](https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/system/files/documents/1702/ghs-information-sheet-23052016.pdf),
have started to adopt some of the trainings from the U.S. but may also
have local labeling systems.

Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
------------------------

Safety Data Sheets or SDS are documents that contain information about
the hazards associated with each chemical and guidance for its safe
handling and disposal. Manufacturers and suppliers of reagents are
required to make a SDS available when a product is purchased. Many of
the larger suppliers (e.g., Sigma Aldrich, VWR) provide SDS files that
can be downloaded from their website for all of the hazardous products
they sell.

Many local regulatory agencies (such as OSHA, the EPA, and most fire
departments) recommend or require having a physical copy of the SDS for
all chemicals in the lab. We recommend having these sheets alphabetized
in a file and readily accessible in the event of a spill or injury.
Having SDS accessible to emergency service providers and personnel in
the lab is especially useful to quickly look up information about the
chemicals in the lab.

Note that SDS guidance and quality can differ greatly between suppliers
and manufacturers. Before starting work with a hazardous chemical,
consider reading more than one SDS to ensure nothing has been
overlooked.

Types of Hazardous Chemicals
----------------------------

### **Flammable**![](media/image53.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Flammable chemicals are classified by their flash point. They can be
> solids, liquids, or gases. Particular care should be taken with
> solvents that should be handled in a chemical fume hood and not used
> near hot plates which could ignite if spilled, and could easily be
> drawn up into the exhaust ducts with catastrophic consequences.
> Solvents and flammable chemicals should never be stored in standard
> refrigerators and freezers, which contain a source of ignition. If
> temperature-sensitive solvents are needed, store them in "spark-free"
> appliances.
>
> Acetone deserves special mention as a common but very flammable
> solvent with a low flash point (i.e., it can be ignited at a low
> ambient temperature) and therefore presents a significant fire hazard.
> A spill of a gallon bottle of acetone could cause a catastrophic fire
> or explosion so it should not be transported except in sealed chemical
> buckets.
>
> Spilled solvents can also react explosively with chemical oxidizing
> agents (e.g., peroxides, nitric acid). Spilled solvents should
> therefore be contained immediately with chemical spillage absorbent.
> However, absorbent soaked with some solvents can self-ignite if
> improperly disposed of so they should be treated as hazardous waste.
>
> Some chemicals can undergo spontaneous combustion as well. A common
> example is linseed oil, which can self-ignite if left to dry on oily
> rags (see [[Example
> 1]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDPLFoWNlV8) and [[Example
> 2]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw5MqfrxM9g)).
>
> **Storage:** Flammables should be stored in a metal safety cabinet
> away from any oxidizing agents and sources of heat.
>
> Total quantities of flammable liquid kept in a lab should be kept to a
> minimum and not exceed 50 liters. No more than 500 ml of flammable
> liquid should be kept on the open bench at any one time (i.e., only
> use the minimum amount of flammable liquid needed to carry out work).
> Flammable liquids should be removed to a suitable cabinet when not in
> use or no longer required.
>
> Flammable substances must be kept away from sources of ignition
> including open flames, electrical hot plates, and non-flameproof
> equipment. Care should be taken when heating substances with low
> auto-ignition temperatures in order to prevent a fire or explosion.
> They should also be stored away from any oxidising agent.
>
> Flammable, highly flammable liquids, or extremely flammable liquids
> (i.e., liquids with a flash point of 60ºC or less, including acetic
> acid, ethanol, and ether), should be stored in sealed containers in
> fire-resistant enclosures or cabinets.
>
> Flammables must only be stored in refrigerators and freezers expressly
> designed for the purpose (i.e., those identified as "spark-proofed" or
> "sparkfree," which have all ignition sources removed). Storing
> flammable solvents in normal refrigerators has caused many lab
> explosions.
>
> **Disposal:** Larger quantities of almost all flammables must be
> disposed of by a hazardous waste contractor. Smaller quantities of
> dilute ethanol could be poured down the drain if allowed by local
> regulations.
>
> **Cautionary tale:** At Michigan State University, a container of
> flammable liquid stored in a household refrigerator was ignited. The
> refrigerator door was blown across the room, windows broken, and the
> contents of the fridge scattered (see photos
> [[here]{.ul}](https://ehs.msu.edu/news/2015-07-10-fridge-explosion.html)).

### **Corrosives** ![](media/image51.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Corrosives are acids below pH 4 and bases above pH 10. They can
> destroy tissue on contact, damage metals and plastics, and liberate
> oxygen from oxidizers or even chemicals not typically known to be
> oxidizers. They are possibly self-igniting, and mixing strong acids
> and bases can have violent reactions.
>
> **Storage:** Corrosive acids and bases should be stored separately
> from each other and in cabinets with protected shelving (not bare
> metal shelves). They should be stored away from oxidizers, flammable
> liquids, and flammable solids.
>
> Inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric
> acid, chromic acid, nitric acid) should not be stored with organic
> acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, formic acid).
>
> Likewise, inorganic bases (e.g., ammonium hydroxide, potassium
> hydroxide, sodium hydroxide) should not be stored with organic bases
> (e.g., hydroxylamine, tetramethylethylamine diamine, triethylamine).
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### **Bases** 

> Bases have a pH above 7. Strong bases include: lime, sodium hydroxide
> (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)~2~),
> cesium hydroxide (CsOH), strontium hydroxide (Sr(OH)~2~), lithium
> hydroxide (LiOH), sodium amide (NaNH~2~), and sodium hydride (NaH).
>
> **Storage:** See guidance for corrosives above.
>
> **Disposal:** Very dilute bases can be neutralized and disposed of
> down the drain (use pH strips to check for successful neutralization).
> For concentrated bases or large volumes, use a hazardous waste
> contractor.

### **Acids**

> Acids have a pH below 7. Strong acids include: vinegar, lemon juice,
> hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H~2~SO~4~), nitric acid,
> HNO~3~. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) presents a significant hazard for
> personal injury. We do not recommend its use in community labs.
>
> **Storage:** See guidance for corrosives above.
>
> **Disposal:** Very dilute acids can be neutralized and disposed of
> down the drain (use pH strips to check for successful neutralisation).
> For concentrated acids or large volumes, use a hazardous waste
> contractor.

### **Oxidizers**![](media/image61.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Oxidizers are chemicals that generate or liberate oxygen when they
> decompose or decompose other chemicals. If heat or flame is present,
> oxidizers decomposing under heat can cause the resulting fire to burn
> hotter and larger, thus decomposing more of the chemical and
> liberating more oxygen in the process.
>
> **Storage:** Oxidizers should be stored in a chemical safety cabinet
> away from strong acids and bases, flammables, combustibles, and
> organic materials. Oxidizers can be stored with non-combustibles or
> inorganic material.
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### **Explosives** ![](media/image40.png){width="0.9149311023622048in" height="0.9149311023622048in"}

> Explosives are chemicals that by their very nature are unstable and
> can release energy and gas rapidly. Chemicals may become explosive by
> heating, adding an oxidizer, or water. In some cases, just the
> presence of air can cause rapid decomposition. Explosives are not
> recommended in community labs.
>
> **Storage:** Store explosives in a secure location away from other
> chemicals and sources of heat, shock, or friction.
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### **Peroxidizables** ![](media/image61.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Peroxides are highly oxidizing materials and considerable energy can
> be released in reactions with common materials. Some peroxide
> compounds are unstable and can explode. Extreme care should be used in
> mixing solutions containing peroxides. Peroxides are incompatible with
> all forms of organic solvents and flammable materials.
>
> **Storage:** Peroxidizables should be stored in a chemical safety
> cabinet away from strong acids and bases, flammables, combustibles and
> organic materials. Oxidizers can be stored with non-combustibles or
> inorganic material.
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### **Toxic** ![](media/image46.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Toxic chemicals interrupt normal function of cellular activity and may
> cause death. Toxic chemicals vary in lethality. Toxins are typically
> quantified using the acronym LD~50~. The LD~50~ is the dose that is
> fatal to 50% of test subjects. It is important to understand the
> exposure routes and limits in order to manage the risk.
>
> **Storage:** Store toxic chemicals in a ventilated, dry, cool area.
> Highly toxic chemicals should be stored securely in chemically
> resistant secondary containers.
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### [**Carcinogens**](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/carcinogens/index.html)![](media/image33.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Carcinogens are chemicals that cause cancer. Examples include some DNA
> stains (ethidium bromide is a suspected mutagen) or other compounds
> that bind to DNA. Other well-known carcinogens include asbestos,
> ionizing radiation, smoke, wood dust, and formaldehyde. More details
> can be found at the [[American Cancer
> Society]{.ul}](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/general-info/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html).
>
> **Storage:** Carcinogens should be stored in accordance with the SDS
> and other chemical properties. Store carcinogens in a ventilated, dry,
> cool area.
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

### [**Teratogens**](https://www.chw.org/medical-care/genetics-and-genomics-program/medical-genetics/teratogens)![](media/image33.png){width="0.8020833333333334in" height="0.8020833333333334in"}

> Teratogens use the same pictogram as carcinogens and are chemicals
> that cause harm to unborn fetuses. Classic example is thalidomide
> exposure where the drug had [[unforeseen health effects on
> fetuses]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/booming/the-death-and-afterlife-of-thalidomide.html).
> Examples of teratogens that could be encountered in labs are ethanol,
> chloroform, phenol, formaldehyde, toluene, [[phenytoin
> (dilantin)]{.ul}](https://www.chw.org/medical-care/genetics-and-genomics-program/medical-genetics/teratogens/phenytoin-dilantin),
> and

> (find more from this list at [[Purdue
> University]{.ul}](https://www.purdue.edu/ehps/rem/laboratory/HazMat/Chemical%20Materials/terat.html)).
> Pregnant women, or women considering becoming pregnant, should consult
> with their doctor prior to working with these chemicals. In some
> cases, harmful exposure is easy to avoid through standard laboratory
> practice. In some situations, it may be necessary to seek alternative
> protocols or put in place additional safety measures.
>
> **Storage:** Store teratogens in accordance with the SDS and other
> chemical properties. Store teratogens in a ventilated, dry, cool area.
>
> **Disposal:** Usually via hazardous waste contractor although
> chemicals of many classes can be teratogens so check specific SDS.

### **Chlorinated Solvents**

> Chlorinated solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene, trichloroethylene, and
> methylene chloride) are used in various etching processes. They have
> no pictogram. They are particularly harmful, and can cause cancer,
> organ damage, and death. They should not be mixed with normal solvents
> in waste bottles. There should be separate waste bottles for
> chlorinated solvents. As with most solvents, they can be readily
> absorbed through the skin. We recommend not to use chlorinated
> solvents in community labs.
>
> **Storage:** Store in ventilated cabinets separately from flammable
> solvents. In some cases, chlorinated and non-chlorinated solvents can
> react violently when mixed. Chlorinated solvents will also react
> strongly with alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, etc.). These
> substances should never be stored together
>
> **Disposal:** Hazardous waste contractor.

Chemical Whitelists 
-------------------

Chemical whitelists, such as the one at
[[BUGSS]{.ul}](http://www.smilesaidtheriver.com/bugsswordpress2/list-pre-approved-organisms-chemicals/)
can be useful to quickly inform members of chemicals or mixtures that
are generally considered safe and may be used in the space under certain
conditions, typically without project review. A whitelist should be
developed by the safety team with input from the membership. If
possible, consult with experts about local regulations and standards.
Safety and health experts from local government, waste haulers, and
universities are often forthcoming with their knowledge and may assist
in creating good safety policies for the lab. Chemicals whitelists still
require the user to know about the chemical's characteristics, disposal,
storage, ownership responsibilities, labeling, or incompatibility of
that chemical with other chemicals. Even if a chemical is on a whitelist
it does not mean that the chemical is safe in all cases.

The whitelist should include warning symbols and language necessary to
convey the associated hazards. Whitelists should also include
information about storage, chemical incompatibilities, any legal limits
on maximum aggregate amount that may be stored in the lab, disposal
requirements, and reference local regulations and resources for proper
disposal.

Whitelists should be clearly posted both in and around the lab as well
as on the lab's website. The website provides ease of access and it can
be consistently referenced and updated. We recommend that all copies
refer to that location as the most up to date version. The whitelist
should also include a version or tracking number to help keep the
information up-to-date.

When to Use a Fume Hood
-----------------------

Does your lab have a chemical fume hood? Note that a biosafety cabinet
is not a fume hood. Most fume hoods are vented to the outside world, but
zoning and other local regulations may prohibit you from having a
chemical fume hood in your lab. Instead of external venting, some fume
hoods use activated carbon filters to remove chemicals. However, such
fume hoods can only handle specific classes of chemicals and may pose a
safety hazard when used by unsuspecting beginners! If feasible, it can
be a great asset to have in your lab. For a demonstration on fume hoods
[[click
here]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlAaEpWQdwA&feature=youtu.be).
In general, a fume hood should be used when working with:

-   Chemicals with a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Health
    > rating of 3 or 4

-   Toxic volatile materials (chloroform, formaldehyde)

-   Flammable chemicals

-   Carcinogens or particularly hazardous substances

-   A procedure that may create an aerosol of a toxic substance

-   Reactive or explosive materials or chemicals that may spatter

-   Toxic gases (NH3, CO, F2, Cl2, H2S, NO2, etc.)

-   Odorous materials, both hazardous and non-hazardous

do/don't protect against (Source: Biological Safety Cabinets "A
Web-based Training Program" Eagleson Institute
[[www.eagleson.org]{.ul}](http://www.eagleson.org)).

Chemical Procurement and Distribution
-------------------------------------

Plan experiments with safety in mind. Avoid the use of hazardous
chemicals altogether (e.g., do not use phenol-chloroform based DNA
extractions) or substitute less hazardous chemicals in lab procedures
when possible. Examples include substituting methyl tertiary-butyl ether
(MTBE) for ethyl ether, safer blue-light absorbing dyes like SYBR for
DNA staining instead of ethidium bromide, formaldehyde-free biological
preserving solutions, toluene for benzene, and dichloromethane for
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Many suggestions for additional
substitutions and [[Green
Chemistry]{.ul}](https://www.pnas.org/content/105/36/13197) methods are
available online.

Safer Alternatives for Common Hazardous Chemicals
-------------------------------------------------

See also [[Safer chemicals & products for use in the
lab]{.ul}](https://www.safety.duke.edu/laboratory-safety/work-practices-ppe/safer-alternatives)
by Duke University

### Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)

Chemicals like ethidium bromide are used to stain DNA during gel
electrophoresis, quantitative PCR, and other techniques. EtBr poses two
significant hazards: (1) Since it fluoresces in UV light, it requires
the use of a UV transilluminator to visualize the presence of the DNA,
so a suitable cabinet and eye protection must be used to prevent eye
damage. (The UV will also damage the DNA in the gel, which makes cutting
out fragments from a gel more of a challenge.) (2) EtBr binds to DNA by
intercalating between the base pairs. Like virtually all DNA stains,
this makes it somewhat mutagenic. While the LD~50~ of these types of
compounds is reported to be low (\~100 mg/kg), the long-term effects may
increase the risk of cancer.

Ideally community labs should only use DNA stains that do not require
the use of UV light, are non-mutagenic, and cannot cross the cell
membrane. We recommend that community labs do not use ethidium bromide
and switch to blue-light excitable, less toxic stains (e.g., blue-light
excitable stains like SYBRSafe, SafeView, GelRed), but be aware that
these may still require hazardous waste disposal depending on local
regulations and typically have no or few validated decontamination
methods. Always use the proper personal protective equipment when using
stains.

**Storage and disposal of EtBr and other DNA stains:** Check
manufacturer\'s instructions and local regulations as these can vary. In
some cases, very dilute solutions (e.g., running buffer where the stain
was added directly to the gel) can be disposed of down the drain, and
gels can be disposed of in standard solid waste. In some cases any
contaminated solutions and solids must be disposed of via a hazardous
waste contractor.

Concentrated solutions of DNA stain should always be disposed of via a
hazardous waste contractor. To cut down on the volume of waste and
reduce costs, activated carbon can be used to destain solutions of
ethidium bromide allowing the solution to be disposed of in the drain,
and only the carbon would need to be disposed of via a hazardous waste
contractor. Destaining bags are available commercially for this purpose
or you can make up and validate your own, as activated carbon is readily
available. There are numerous guides online to decontaminating ethidium
bromide using DIY and commercially available solutions (e.g., from
[[Columbia]{.ul}](https://research.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/EHS/Policies/EthidiumBromidePolicy.pdf)
and
[[Berkeley]{.ul}](https://www.ehs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/lines-of-services/workplace-safety/47ethidiumbromide.pdf)).

### Phenol/Chloroform (Trizol)

Many older protocols for DNA and RNA extraction rely on the use of
phenol/chloroform (or Trizol). However both phenol and chloroform pose
significant health hazards. Phenol can cause severe burns to the eyes
and skin, and acts as a systemic toxin. Chloroform is a carcinogen, and
enhances the ability of phenol to be absorbed by the skin. Both phenol
and chloroform rapidly permeate nitrile and other glove materials. The
use of phenol/chloroform or Trizol requires safety goggles, special
chemical-resistant gloves, is incompatible with contact lenses, and
should ideally take place in a chemical fume hood within reach of an
emergency shower. There have been many examples of lab injuries from
phenol/chloroform:

-   [[Fact Sheet: Phenol-Chloroform
    > Extraction]{.ul}](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/health-safety/lab-safety/chemical-hygiene-plan/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-phenol-chloroform-extraction)

For these reasons, we recommend that community labs do NOT use
phenol/chloroform or Trizol**.** In fact, there are several newer
methods for RNA extraction that are significantly simpler, safer, and
more effective. [[This
paper]{.ul}](https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/14/1/268/2384293)
compares four RNA extraction kits on insect larva, and shows that the
two safest methods (RNeasy and Promega\'s SV Total RNA isolation system)
also gave the best quality RNA. [[This
paper]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2576689/)
describes a \"simple and safe\" method for RNA and DNA extraction from
microbes using sodium trichloroacetate. [[This
page]{.ul}](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/ambion-tech-support/rna-isolation/general-articles/ten-ways-to-improve-your-rna-isolation.html)
recommends the Purelink RNA kit from Ambion as the \"easiest and
safest\" method, or the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA Isolation Kit from
Applied Biosystems.

### Sodium Azide 

Sodium azide is a common pest control chemical and chemical preservative
and is also found in air bags and common chemical reactions. It is
extremely toxic in small amounts and can produce toxic gases when mixed
with metals. It is also listed as an [[Extremely Hazardous
Substance]{.ul}](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/appendix-A_to_part_355)
(U.S.), and is therefore regulated and can carry legal penalties for
improper disposal. Some companies will try and dump this on unsuspecting
labs. More information can be found at the
[[CDC]{.ul}](https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sodiumazide/basics/facts.asp).
Alternatives to sodium azide include [[1-2%
2-chloroacetamide]{.ul}](https://www.safety.duke.edu/laboratory-safety/work-practices-ppe/safer-alternatives)
and [[ProClin and
Kathon]{.ul}](https://viceprovost.tufts.edu//ehs/files/Sodium-Azide-SOP-2015.v2.pdf)

### Cycloheximide

Cycloheximide is an anti-fungal commonly recommended in protocols to
select bacterial isolates from mixed cultures. It is toxic to humans and
wildlife as well. We recommend using Nystatin (50 mg/L) or Natamycin
(21.6 mg/L) as an antifungal in selective media or for plant tissue
culturing. For example, the kombucha Genomics project at Counter Culture
Labs has had good results using Nystatin.

-   [[Natamycin as a Fungicide in Agar
    Media]{.ul}](https://aem.asm.org/content/aem/58/3/1064.full.pdf)

Inventorying Chemicals 
----------------------

Maintaining a list of all the chemicals in your lab and controlling what
comes into the lab is essential for the overall safety of the lab. It's
also imperative information for building managers and emergency
services, particularly firefighters and first responders. The
information may take the form of a spreadsheet or a special inventory
application system, some of which have free tiers (e.g.,
[[ChemInventory]{.ul}](https://www.cheminventory.net/) is free for up to
200 containers).

The inventory should be accessible to all members. If your inventory is
kept digitally, consider printing a hard copy to have on hand for easy
reference. Make sure the inventory is updated regularly, and check local
laws regarding chemical record keeping and reporting.

### Labeling Chemicals in the Lab

Labeling all chemicals, mixtures, and reagents is a necessity. Many of
the reagents encountered in the lab are clear liquids, which presents a
challenge in trying to differentiate them from each other or water. Some
countries, such as the U.S., require that chemicals be labeled or
demarcated in a manner where all personnel understand the hazards of the
material. Use of particular symbols, pictograms, warning words, may be a
requirement of local laws and regulations.

When labeling a chemical container, include the following information:

-   Chemical name (e.g., sodium chloride or its chemical formula, NaCl)

-   Concentration

-   Date received or date opened (depending on the hazardous properties
    > of the chemical)

-   Name or initials of owner

-   Owners contact information (e.g., phone number or email)

-   Hazard symbols or words like flammable, corrosive, and toxic

Print or write this information on a readable surface with a sharpie or
permanent marker. This can be done on tape or directly on the container
itself. Always consider whether the label and writing is resistant to
the chemical in the container and to smudging. A label printer may save
time and hassle. Some inventorying systems are even able to print
GHS-compliant labels for chemicals on demand (e.g.,
[[ChemInventory]{.ul}](https://www.cheminventory.net/)).

Chemical Storage and Compatibility
----------------------------------

We recommend following the guidelines below when storing chemicals:

-   Only keep the minimum stock of substances necessary for the work at
    > hand in the lab.

-   Storage in the lab should be in properly designated areas.

-   Chemicals not in use should be returned promptly to their correct
    > storage enclosures or cabinets.

-   Light-sensitive substances (e.g., chlorinated solvents) should be
    > stored in amber-colored bottles away from the light.

-   Do not store substances, especially liquids on the floor, under
    > benches, or where they can be struck by shoes, doors, trolleys, or
    > carts. In addition, do not store chemicals in direct sunlight,
    > such as by windows.

-   Liquids or heavy containers and equipment should not be stored above
    > average chest height if in frequent use. This may be acceptable
    > for occasionally used equipment or long-term storage. Users should
    > follow good manual handling practice in retrieving the item.

-   Do not store chemically incompatible substances together.

 

### Chemical Storage Cabinets

When chemical storage cabinets are recommended, they should be solid
metal construction, ventilated, and lockable. For storing some
corrosives, the metal shelves should be protected by a non-corroding
coating. It is recommended to have chemicals stored in secondary
containment in case of primary container failing.

Hazardous Chemical Waste Disposal
---------------------------------

See the sections above and [[Chapter 12 - Waste
Disposal]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/edit#heading=h.rpyjx7hw619m),
for specific information on disposing of chemicals in particular classes
and the SDS of individual chemicals.

**Do**

-   Adequately contain waste in resistant bottles and containers that
    > are closed at all times but appropriately ventilated if the
    > chemical is volatile.

-   Place liquid waste containers in secondary containers (pans or
    > trays) to minimize the risk of leaks.

-   Clearly label everything. Consider having standard chemical disposal
    > tags, forms, and a chemical waste store, so that lab members can
    > dispose of chemical waste at the earliest opportunity in
    > accordance with local laws.

-   Use a hazardous waste contractor for disposing of chemical waste.
    > Contact local companies to find out about their service. If you
    > are associated with a university, you may be able to take
    > advantage of their high volume contracts to save on costs.

-   Dispose of empty chemical containers with hazardous waste or recycle
    > them.

-   Identify appropriate disposal processes before chemicals enter the
    > lab.

-   Include chemical waste disposal in the risk assessment.

-   Seek professional advice if unsure of how to dispose of a particular
    > chemical.

-   Consider organising an annual chemical inventory and clean-up day to
    > ensure that old or unwanted chemicals do not accumulate in the lab
    > from ex-members or old projects.

**Don't**

-   Mix incompatible chemicals.

-   Discard chemicals in sinks, biological waste, or general waste.

-   Dispose of volatile chemicals by evaporation.

-   Put waste containers in hallways or other public locations

-   Move chemicals with precipitation on or in the bottle

-   Dispose of chemically contaminated sharps and broken glass in
    > standard chemical waste. se a sharps box or glass bucket.

Radiation Safety
----------------

In biotechnology the use of radioactivity is an antiquated practice. The
research community has aggressively turned away from the use of
radiation for better methods and cheaper tools and techniques that are
less dangerous to the users and the environment. We strongly recommend
against working with radioactivity.

Some community labs have been offered or received donated equipment that
had been exposed to radioactive material. Sometimes the previous owner
viewed donation as an easy disposal route because all the costs and
risks of appropriate disposal are thus passed to the community lab.

We recommend not accepting donations of equipment that you suspect has
been exposed to radiation---watch out for radioactive warning labels and
bear in mind that sometimes people peel them off. If you do end up with
equipment in your lab about which you have concerns, contact someone
with access to and experience in using a calibrated geiger counter to
test the equipment. If it is radioactive, contact local specialist
disposal contractors to establish how to get rid of it and anticipate
that this could be expensive.

Compressed Gases and Cryogens
-----------------------------

The most common compressed gases used at community labs are nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, propane, and compressed air. Although commonly used,
these can pose a danger if there is a tank rupture. Compressed gas tanks
have been known to release their contents rapidly, thus accelerating the
tank through walls or spinning in a small enclosed space, as proven by
Myth Busters in [[this
video]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejEJGNLTo84). In addition,
the escaping gas could be toxic or an asphyxiant.

### Risk Assessment for Use of Gases

-   Calculate the room air volume and gas volume to understand the
    > concentrations that might be produced under the worst case
    > scenario (e.g., a sudden discharge of the stored gas). If this
    > results in toxic levels of carbon dioxide or oxygen depletion to
    > below 19.5%, consider other scenarios in detail. Do not factor in
    > mechanical ventilation to the risk assessment because it may fail
    > or be turned off and that has been implicated in the death of a
    > researcher in the
    > [[UK]{.ul}](https://press.hse.gov.uk/2017/12/12/nhs-trust-and-imperial-college-london-fined-after-death-of-worker/).

-   If necessary, based on the calculation and risk assessment, install
    > carbon dioxide monitoring equipment and oxygen monitoring
    > equipment that alerts users to dangerous levels.

-   Install signage and ensure all personnel are trained to recognize
    > the alarms and know what to do.

### Storage, Use, and Transport of Gas Cylinders

Exercise care when handling compressed gases and cryogens, especially
during transport and storage.

**Cylinder Storage**

-   Large cylinders must be secured to a wall, bench or fixed support
    > using a chain or strap placed at 2/3 the height of the cylinder.
    > They should remain mounted during storage and use.

-   Cylinder stands could be used as an alternative to straps if it is
    > not possible to affix straps to the wall.

-   Ensure the cap protecting the cylinder valve is secured at all times
    > and keep the valve closed at all times except when in use.

-   Ensure that smaller tanks are not stored in a place where they could
    > be dropped, bumped into (e.g., by passing trolleys that could snap
    > a valve), or exposed to heat.

-   Store empty cylinders closed and secured in a separate location from
    > full cylinders. They should be stored for easy removal.

-   Always ensure that all users are trained in the proper mounting,
    > use, and transport of compressed gases. See more information from
    > [[OSHA]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/compressedgasequipment/index.html)).

**Cylinder Transport**

Always use a proper gas cylinder hand cart or truck to which the
cylinders can be secured during transport with a chain or belt, even for
short distances, e.g., between labs.

**Use of Gas Cylinders**

-   Never tamper with pressure relief devices and regulators on valves
    > or cylinders.

-   Use the correct tools when manipulating the regulator.

-   Only use compressed gases in a well-ventilated area and never in a
    > cold room.

-   Any toxic, flammable, and corrosive gases should be handled in a
    > chemical fume hood.

-   Always label gas lines if more than one type of gas is in use.

-   Inspect valves and tubing regularly for wear, tear, and leaks using
    > soapy water.

-   Use the appropriate, manufacturer-recommended regulator for the
    > cylinder and never substitute another regulator.

-   Don't use oil or grease to seal the O-ring on the regulator as it is
    > flammable.

### Carbon Dioxide Gas

Carbon dioxide gas is used for mammalian tissue culture and as an
anaesthetic for insects like *Drosophila*. The main safety concerns,
besides the physical hazards associated with compressed gas tanks
(covered above), are carbon dioxide toxicity, and oxygen displacement.
At concentrations between 2 and 10%, carbon dioxide causes an increased
respiratory rate, nausea, dizziness, headache, mental confusion, and
increased blood pressure. If the carbon dioxide concentration rises
above 10%, suffocation and death can occur in minutes.

**Risk Assessment**

You should calculate the worst-case scenario if there was a carbon
dioxide leak into the lab and assume that the entire cylinder is
released (e.g., using this calculator from the [[University of
Nottingham]{.ul}](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/safetyCalculators/Calc-CO2.htm)).

**Safety Measures**

If a leak would result in dangerous levels of carbon dioxide, then you
should install a carbon dioxide monitor and alarm system that can be
seen and/or heard from the outside of the lab so no-one enters the room.
Portable carbon dioxide monitors are available but not recommended as
the primary monitoring system; they are intended for people working in
confined spaces or as a backup alert.

Remember that a monitor only provides a warning that the sensor is
detecting a potentially dangerous concentration of a particular gas. The
detector is not in itself a safety device and will not fix the problem
so you will need to put in place safety measures:

-   Ensure that it is adequate and consider forced
    > ventilation/extraction.

-   If you have fitted gas detection monitors/alarms, ensure they are
    > tested, calibrated, and periodically replaced as per
    > manufacturer's instructions.

-   Consider fitting safety devices to cylinders, e.g., excess flow
    > valves detect drops in pressure and drastically reduce the flow of
    > gas from the cylinder.

-   Use cable ties and clips to ensure that any tubing is secured and
    > cannot be accidentally pulled off causing a leak.

-   Have a regime for checking and maintenance of regulators.

-   Train users to operate the equipment safely, recognize the signs of
    > carbon dioxide leaks, interpret the monitor and alarm, and know
    > what to do in an emergency.

-   Have a documented plan for responding to a carbon dioxide leak and
    > safely ventilating the room.

### Liquid Nitrogen (LN2)

Cryogens, such as liquid nitrogen, are used to preserve biological
specimens or to rapidly freeze them for processing. Liquid nitrogen can
rapidly deplete oxygen from the air and is the cause of several deaths
in labs. One liter of liquid nitrogen produces approximately 680 litres
of gas at room temperature which displace oxygen and lead to
suffocation.

**Risk Assessment**

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has a simple Oxygen Deficiency
Hazard (ODH) calculator that is useful to determine which rooms are
suitable for storing a liquid nitrogen dewar of a specific size,
including refills and a use case:

-   [[Oxygen Deficiency Hazard (ODH) calculator
    > spreadsheet]{.ul}](https://www.lbl.gov/ehs/pub3000/CH29/CH29-ODH_70A-2211.xls)
    > (.xls)

-   [[Appendix B: An Overview of the ODH Calculator
    > Model]{.ul}](https://www2.lbl.gov/ehs/pub3000/CH29/CH29.html#AppB)

**Safety Measures**

If a leak would result in dangerous levels of oxygen, then you should
install an oxygen monitor and alarm system that can be seen and/or heard
from the outside of the lab so no-one enters the room. You should also
consider the following safety measures:

-   Only store liquid nitrogen in rooms with good natural ventilation or
    > install forced ventilation.

-   If you have fitted oxygen detection monitors/alarms, ensure they are
    > tested, calibrated and periodically replaced as per manufacturer's
    > instructions.

-   If transported inside a vehicle, make sure to leave windows rolled
    > down to avoid suffocation hazard.

-   Liquid nitrogen dewars should never be accompanied in an
    > elevator---have one person place the dewar in the elevator, while
    > a second person waits on the destination floor.

-   Liquid nitrogen contact with skin may cause serious freezing
    > (frostbite) injury. Wear insulated gloves at all times that are
    > rated for use with liquid nitrogen. Note that this usually does
    > not mean you could put your gloved hand into the liquid
    > nitrogen---use tongs to retrieve items.

-   Wear protective clothing including a lab coat, long-sleeves and
    > pants to be sure that no skin is exposed.

-   Wear safety glasses and ideally a face shield when transferring or
    > pouring liquid nitrogen to avoid being splashed in the face or
    > eyes.

**Dry Ice**
-----------

Another source of carbon dioxide is dry ice, which is extremely cold,
solid CO2 and is a simple asphyxiant. One kilogram of dry ice produces
540 liters of carbon dioxide gas. Therefore, 10 kg in an average cold
room could reduce the oxygen level below 15% and also create a
potentially lethal concentration of carbon dioxide.

**Safety Measures**

Other safety measures for handling and transporting dry ice include:

-   Dry ice should therefore always be stored in a well-ventilated area
    > and never in a sealed container, this include tightly taped
    > polystyrene boxes (tape on three sides only) and ultralow
    > temperature freezers. Otherwise the pressure build-up as it
    > sublimated could lead to an explosion or rupture of the container.

-   If transported inside a vehicle, make sure to leave windows rolled
    > down, to avoid any suffocation hazard. You will also need to label
    > the box as a hazardous material (see [[Acquiring, Shipping and
    > Transporting
    > Materials]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#heading=h.orodespoomca)).

-   Wear protective clothing. Use insulated gloves that are made of a
    > thick material; also wear proper clothing (long-sleeves and pants)
    > to be sure that no skin is exposed.

-   Do not dump dry ice down the drain! It may damage the sink or
    > plumbing. Allow it to sublimate at room temperature in a very well
    > ventilated space, ideally outside, or in an externally vented fume
    > hood.

Drugs and Controlled Substances
-------------------------------

Community labs are advised not to store or use any drugs or controlled
substances in their protocols. In the U.S., the [[Drug Enforcement
Agency]{.ul}](https://www.dea.gov/about) strictly regulates these
materials. Refer to local regulations for more information.

**11. Acquiring, Shipping and Transporting Materials**
======================================================

Formal and informal material transfers are essential for research and
can be made in different ways: company to community lab, community lab
to community lab, university to community lab, individual researcher to
individual researcher, and many more configurations.

In this chapter, we focus largely on acquiring, shipping, and
transporting biological materials with a summary of regulations for
chemicals. We strongly recommend not sharing chemicals between labs and
avoiding taking responsibility for shipping and transporting them
whenever possible because you have legal responsibilities from inception
to final disposal (i.e., "cradle to grave").

Acquiring Biological Materials
------------------------------

Be mindful of where you source your lab materials. Caution must be taken
to ensure that the materials are exactly what you think they are.
Remember that you are legally responsible for custody of materials from
the time they reach you and sometimes before---make sure to check the
terms and conditions of the provider.

There are many reputable repositories and companies providing biological
materials and chemicals commercially. Also, you can often approach
researchers to obtain materials referenced in publications. It is common
to share or deposit those materials so that other scientists can
reproduce and expand upon the work and in some cases making materials
available is a condition of publication.

Regardless of the method of acquiring materials, always make an effort
to independently verify materials that enter the lab (e.g., through DNA
sequencing of new strains or DNA plasmids).

### Educational Suppliers

Various educational suppliers sell a range of safe bacterial, fungal,
and algal species for as little as \$10 each (watch out for shipping
costs though). Some claim to only sell to schools and educators,
although being an educational nonprofit with a business address (or a
homeschooler) usually qualifies a community biology lab. It is highly
advisable to ask any supplier exactly which strain they are selling.
They should be able to provide an official strain name or a culture
collection accession number. If not, consider buying from a different
source.

### Cheesemaking, Brewing, and Other Sourcing Options

A number of cheesemaking or brewing bacteria, yeasts, and molds may be
purchased online, sometimes in a convenient freeze-dried form. This may
be one of the cheapest ways to put together a large collection of safe
cultures with interesting properties.

### Biotech Companies

Genetic engineering often utilizes strains of *E. coli*, yeast, *Pichia
pastoris*, or other organisms that have been optimized for cloning or
protein expression (e.g., knocking out protease genes that could
interfere with high protein production). These genetic engineering
strains are typically sold by biotech companies for a significant
markup, often as competent cells in small aliquots ready for a
transformation reaction. Check the fine-print: some of these commercial
strains also carry licensing restrictions on what can be done with them,
including prohibiting redistribution and commercial use. Most companies
will not sell to individuals, and your organization will need to provide
a business address, and sometimes proof of non-profit or company status.
Through networking, it may be possible to obtain the workhorse strains,
such as *E. coli* BL21 for free from a university lab or other resource.

### Academic Labs

Academic labs are expected to share research materials with other
researchers, as part of the normal lab etiquette in life sciences.
Indeed, many scientific journals require authors to share research
materials associated with a publication upon request. Try contacting the
head of the lab, the lab manager, or the first or last author on a
paper, and ask them kindly whether they would be willing to share their
strains and plasmids with you. You may want to include how you will be
using these materials, to assure them that you are not trying to scoop
them on ongoing research. Many universities will ask you to sign a
Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), although some researchers may skip
this if you deal with them directly.

Not all academic researchers are equally conscientious when it comes to
biosafety, and some microbiologists can be particularly nonchalant. Some
questions you may want to ask from your academic collaborators include:

-   Is this a Risk Group 1 organism, and if so, what evidence did you
    > base this assignment on?

-   Has this organism been submitted to a culture collection, and if so,
    > what RG did they assign to it?

-   Was this organism isolated in a BSL-2 lab?

-   Do you have any sequence data for this organism, and if so, how far
    > is it from any known pathogens? If they're not sure, be sure to
    > ask them to provide the sequence.

### Other Community Labs and Biohackers

When acquiring strains from a commercial supplier, you can assume there
has been some amount of formal quality control on the product you are
buying. When dealing with fellow community labs, you only have the word
of the person you're exchanging materials with. Not all community labs
will have the same standards when it comes to biosafety, so the more
information you can get to document the identity and provenance of the
strains, the better!

If you are getting a commercial strain from a community lab, ask them
for the exact strain ID of the organism, and if possible a copy of
whatever paperwork came with the strain from the original supplier. If
this lab was not the one that acquired the strain in the first place,
ask them where they got it from. Also ask for any sequence data (e.g.,
16S) they may have available on this strain. If your source has little
or no information on the strain, or if you have any uncertainty
regarding its identity or safety, we strongly recommend you take a pass,
and try to find another source.

If the lab you hope to get the strain from isolated it themselves, they
should be able to provide you at a minimum with a DNA sequence based
identification, and a risk assessment as outlined in [[Chapter 14 -
Working with
Microbes]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w).
If they cannot provide you with that information, you are better off
finding another source instead of risking bringing in a potentially
hazardous organism.

### Culture Collections

There are many stock centers for organisms, chemicals, and other
materials like DNA. Stock centers may require different information
depending on local, state, and federal regulations, so there may be some
hurdles along the way. Be patient with the process and courteous when
working with the stock center.

When professional labs need a new bacterial strain, they will often turn
to one of the very large culture collections such as the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Unfortunately, that often also means paying
"professional" rates, but there are definitely some deals to be found.

-   [[American Type Culture Collection
    > (ATCC)]{.ul}](http://www.atcc.org/): ATCC is a private,
    > not-for-profit biological resource center focusing on standard
    > reference microorganisms, cell lines, and other materials for life
    > sciences research. Non-profit rates are typically around \$300 for
    > a strain, but some type strains are only around \$50.

-   [[NRRL ARS Strain Collection]{.ul}](https://nrrl.ncaur.usda.gov/):
    > NRRL offers 24 strains per year FREE (+shipping). NRRL also has a
    > large 'Patent collection' not listed in the online catalog, but
    > which can be ordered if the NRRL number is provided from a patent
    > or paper.

### Providing Information to Culture Collections

All stock centers require information before you can order stocks and
you should fill out their forms as best you can. As many are not used to
working with community labs, it is likely you will encounter questions
you can't answer. Don't be afraid to ask for guidance on how to proceed.
Many stock centers have programs that support education. They are often
flexible when working with schools, museums, and science centers.
Information requested may include:

-   Contact person (they might ask for their professional degree or
    > experience)

-   Account address (often require a commercial address and will not
    > deliver to a residential address)

-   EIN---Employer Identification Number or similar tax ID number

-   DUNS---Dun and Bradstreet ID number for Federal Grants (U.S. only)

-   Business license or company/non-profit information

-   State or local tax information

-   Evidence of relevant permits (GMO, BSL level)

-   Evidence that you have appropriate facilities and safety policies in
    > place to handle the material

-   Insurance certificates

-   Name of lab director who can sign material transfer agreements

-   Rental agreement

You might need to apply for permission from them to receive materials.
Have resources ready to prove that you are a reputable organization with
a public mission. For example, BioCurious has had several instances
where the directors leveraged their media attention to educate stock
centers about the lab's public mission to further education and job
retraining.

Acquiring Chemical Reagents
---------------------------

As recommended in [[Chapter 10 - Chemical
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit),
all new chemicals should be approved by the safety team \*before\* being
ordered, unless they are already on a "White List" of chemicals
pre-approved by the lab. We recommend adopting an ordering system that
allows some checking before an order is placed. For example, Counter
Culture Labs uses [[Quartzy]{.ul}](https://www.quartzy.com/) for almost
all ordering, which has catalogs for all the major reagent suppliers,
and allows separate roles for who may request an order, who may approve
an order, and who can actually pay for an order.

Before ordering new chemicals, check to see if the chemical is available
elsewhere, or if you already have some in the lab and could use, barter,
or pay for what you need. If you have to order it, estimate the amount
of chemical required for each experiment and order only what is
necessary. Also consider whether the concentrated chemical is needed or
if a pre-diluted form may be safer and more convenient. Excess chemicals
are very expensive to dispose of and can cause a hazard if stored too
long. Don't be tempted by the "better value" of a container that is
larger than necessary because the cost of disposing of the excess is
likely to outweigh the savings.

Most chemical suppliers in the U.S. are happy to sell standard lab
reagents to anyone with a credit card and a business address, but using
a residential address or telling them outright that you are a community
lab, DIY lab, or biohackerspace may raise red flags with some suppliers.
Shop around. Very few reagents are sold by only a single supplier, and
reagent prices can vary significantly between suppliers.

Much like biological materials, you may also be able to request
chemicals from academic labs, e.g., new fluorescent dyes, probes. In
this case you may need to complete a material transfer agreement (see
below).

Material Transfer Agreements
----------------------------

Once you are ready to receive materials from another organization you
may need to sign a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), which is a
contract that determines how you can use the material. The agreement
sets forth the terms of the transfer and the boundaries of what you can
and cannot do within the scope of the agreement. This allows researchers
to build on others research but also give credit to others who laid the
groundwork for their discoveries. The restrictions depend on the
organization providing the material.

Some of the common areas in the agreement include:

-   **Attribution**: How to acknowledge the provider of the material in
    > publications, talks, and other output.

-   **Reuse**: Whether it is possible to transfer to another group or
    > individual.

-   **Access**: Who can access the technology. This could be restricted
    > to named individuals or much more open.

-   **Ownership of patents or new IP derived from the materials:** This
    > might include first right of refusal for IP developed on the
    > materials.

-   **Restrictions on the type of work that can be carried out with the
    > material**: Companies may do this to avoid competition with the
    > provider.

-   **NDA (Non-disclosure agreement):** This could restrict you from
    > talking about the material characteristics, associated trade
    > secrets, even the fact that you are working on this material.

-   **The term:** The time length of the agreement.

-   **Jurisdiction**: Where and how violations will be legally
    > determined (court or arbitration) and the jurisdiction.

-   **Disposal:** Methods of destruction of materials.

In theory, transfer terms are open to discussion but in practice most
stock centers and universities will use the Universal Biological MTA
([[UB-MTA]{.ul}](https://autm.net/surveys-and-tools/agreements/material-transfer-agreements/mta-toolkit/uniform-biological-material-transfer-agreement))
or a more restrictive form which prohibits redistribution of the
material to another organization (such as another community lab) and
also its commercial use. The purpose of the UB-MTA is to simplify the
legal process and cut down on the transaction costs of completing MTAs.

In the future, some centers may start using the
[[OpenMTA]{.ul}](https://biobricks.org/openmta/), which is a standard
agreement that explicitly allows redistribution and commercial use. If
you plan to distribute novel materials or DNA from your community lab
and want to ensure that other labs and researchers can use, reuse, and
redistribute those with explicit permission, we recommend that you
become a signatory to the OpenMTA.

As MTAs are a legal contract, the person who signs an MTA on behalf of
your community lab must legally be able to sign contracts on behalf of
the organization. Usually, they will be a lab director, a board member,
or an officially designated representative. Many community labs sign
MTA's on behalf of their members with the lab acting as recipient
organization and the member as "Principal Investigator." However, if a
member has their own company, you might want to encourage them to create
their own account with the stock centers.

A specific reason for this is that your community lab will be held
liable for any breaches of the contract including if that member went on
to use that material for commercial purposes or redistributed it to
another organization. This could lead to legal action by the material
provider against your community lab, a court case, and fines.

For more details on the terms of different standard MTAs, consult the
table below and the MTA resources on the Association of University
Technology Managers (AUTM) website. UB-MTA is very common for publicly
funded, not-for-profit and academic providers but commercial suppliers
will likely have their own custom MTAs, so always read the terms and
conditions thoroughly before you sign and seek (formal or informal)
legal advice if you don't understand something.

If you send material out of your lab to other labs, ensure that you are
permitted to do so under the incoming MTA that you signed. You may also
choose to use an MTA for outgoing material to ensure that the recipients
have a clear paper trail on what they are allowed to do with it and to
limit your liability in terms of the material working in the way you
describe (a no warranties clause).

Introduction to Shipping and Transporting Biological and Chemical Materials
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When shipping or transporting biological, chemical, and other lab
materials it is important to consider the nature of the materials being
shipped, typical storage conditions, the hazards involved, and the
shipping method. By shipping we mean packaging and sending the goods via
a courier or postal service; by transport we mean packaging and moving
the goods yourself. In general the same precautions and packaging
requirements apply to each and you should consider references to
shipping in this section to cover both scenarios unless otherwise
stated.

The main regulatory distinction is between hazardous and non-hazardous
goods**,** but there are other regulations like research permits, lab
permissions, import/export permits, and also customs and quarantine
processes to consider depending on what you are shipping or
transporting, how it is traveling, and where it is going.

Shipping regulations are complex and special attention should be paid to
local details. Shippers in the U.S. can be fined from \$250 to \$500,000
for improper shipping and carriers can refuse improperly packed
packages, so do what you can to avoid unnecessary expense or delays.

You should also consider that in most countries you are legally
responsible for the final disposal of your material (see more in [[Waste
Disposal]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/edit))
(e.g., if you contract a service to remove your chemical or biological
waste and this is later found to be dumped on the side of the road then
you are responsible, not the contractor). This means you also need to be
sure of the reliability of your shipping provider and the person to whom
you are shipping as they will then be disposing of the material.

The following sections will help get you started with some high-level
information and where to go for extra details.

Methods of Shipping and Transporting
------------------------------------

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A few key points:                                                    |
|                                                                      |
| -   Do NOT carry biological materials on a plane---penalties can be  |
|     > severe.                                                        |
|                                                                      |
| -   The simplest way to ship plasmids, DNA, and Risk Group 1 natural |
|     > and GM cultures is to spot them on filter paper, wrap in       |
|     > aluminum foil, enclose in a ziplock bag, and send by courier   |
|     > or regular mail (if in U.S., otherwise check local             |
|     > regulations) accompanied by a cover letter.                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Ground Shipping via Courier

We recommend shipping any hazardous or regulated materials via a
reputable courier who has staff trained to deal with them and to advise
on any special requirements e.g., FedEx, DHL, UPS.

All couriers will have lists of allowed materials. You may have to shop
around for one that will meet your needs. There are specialist couriers
for biological samples which may be helpful if shipping on dry ice or
with other special requirements, e.g., World Courier.

In the U.S., ground shipping is regulated by the U.S. Department of
Transportation
([[DOT]{.ul}](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/Hazmat_Transportation_Training_Requirements.pdf)).

Be aware that not all domestic shipments only travel by ground! Check
with the courier as to whether you also need to follow the rules for
[[Air Shipping via
Courier]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#).

### Ground Shipping via the Postal Service

**U.S.:** Most dangerous goods are NOT permitted in the USPS postal mail
but many biological agents and materials other than Category A
infectious organisms can be sent via 1st class, Priority, or Express
Mail (see [[USPS
regulations]{.ul}](http://pe.usps.com/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub52/pub52.pdf)).

**Europe:** Most dangerous goods are NOT permitted in the standard mail
but check local services.

### Personal Ground Transport

We do not recommend that you transport any hazardous biological or
chemical materials personally by foot, bike, public transport, or in
personal vehicles because U.S. DOT transport regulations apply when
goods are transported on the public highway *by any means*.

If you do, then definitely don't just "put it in the car and move it."
You must follow all standard shipping regulations, packaging, and
labeling requirements described in the hazardous good shipping sections
below. In the U.S., you must also be DOT-trained and certified to
supervise the transport of hazardous goods.

If you decide to self-transport:

-   Keep hazardous material locked in the trunk.

-   Carry two copies of relevant documentation, e.g., shipping
    > declaration, headed paper with description of specimens, intended
    > use, place of origin and destination, contact details of sender
    > and recipient, and emergency contact. Keep one on the package and
    > one with the driver.

-   If transporting regulated infectious substances, then stay with the
    > vehicle at all times (at a minimum, always keep the vehicle within
    > eyesight).

-   Bring two people if driving long distances.

-   Let other people know your itinerary and bring a cell phone in case
    > you run into any problems.

Bear in mind that if you use public transport you are likely to be
breaking the transport company rules on transporting hazardous
substances and your car insurance is unlikely by default to cover
transport of hazardous goods in your personal car.

There are no regulations against transporting non-hazardous goods by
ground transport but be aware of other regulations and permit
requirements. We recommend still following all packaging and labelling
guidelines including triple-packaging for biological materials (see
[[Packaging and Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)). If
there is an accident, it's very important that anything you are carrying
is identifiable by first responders to avoid a major incident.

The largest exception to self transport is [["Materials for
Trade"]{.ul}](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/MOTS%20brochure%202007_10_02.pdf)
(49 CFR Section 173.6), which are small quantities of hazardous
materials that can be purchased in at local vendor and transported
without a DOT oversite. These are intended to be locally used consumer
commodities, for example, gasoline, pool chemicals, rubbing alcohol,
paint, drain cleaner, acetone, diagnostic specimens, bleach, and
propane. Check with your local regulations and relevant authorities.

In the U.S., under the "Very Small Quantity Generator" (VSQG) program,
hazardous chemicals and waste can be transported to disposal locations
under "Materials of Trade" exemption. However, many states have
different regulations on what constitutes proper shipment; therefore, it
is advised to check your local laws. Some localities require you follow
proper packaging, labeling instructions, and relevant paperwork, EPA
permit, waste manifest, and possibly the VSQG paperwork. For examples,
see
[[Minnesota]{.ul}](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw2-53.pdf),
[[Massachusetts,]{.ul}](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/06/28/vsqgsumm.pdf)
[[New York]{.ul}](https://www.dec.ny.gov/25.html), and general [[EPA
guidence]{.ul}](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=12dbfa31159667c702e5ee735c5b06f8&mc=true&node=pt40.28.262&rgn=div5#se40.28.262_114).

### Air Shipping via Courier

We recommend shipping any hazardous or regulated materials by air via a
reputable courier who has staff trained to deal with them and to advise
on any special requirements (e.g., FedEx, DHL, UPS). Not all materials
can be shipped by air. For example, genetically modified organisms and
animals that contain them that are known or suspected of being dangerous
to humans, animals, or the environment must not be transported by air
unless they are exempted by the countries concerned.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) publishes the
"Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by
Air," which are the legally binding international regulations, but most
airlines follow the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) that add some further restrictions.
For domestic flights, national civil aviation authorities apply national
regulations. In the U.S., you should also check the [[TSA
regulations]{.ul}](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/civil-enforcement) and
[[Federal Aviation Agency]{.ul}](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/)
for the national rules. Bear in mind that these international and
national regulations are the minimum requirements, and individual
airlines may be stricter.

### Carry-on Transport

Carrying hazardous biological or chemical materials on an aircraft as a
passenger is generally always prohibited. In principle, non-hazardous
goods are permitted, but we recommend packaging all biological and
chemical materials (whether they are hazardous or not) according to IATA
requirements and using a reputable courier. Don't take the risk of
getting caught with suspicious materials! It is difficult to distinguish
between non-hazardous and hazardous lab samples, and concern over
bioterrorism is heightened. In the best case, your journey will be
delayed while you explain yourself; in the worst case, you could be
refused passage by the airline, fined, and/or detained for breaching
regulations.

Shipping and Transporting Non-Hazardous Materials
-------------------------------------------------

Hazardous materials typically cover the following categories of
materials, and anything falling outside of that is considered
non-hazardous (but always check the DOT, IATA, and UN guidelines):

-   Explosives

-   Gases including liquid nitrogen

-   Flammable liquids including alcohol and formaldehyde

-   Flammable solids

-   Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides

-   Toxic and infectious substances infectious agents and biological
    > substances

-   Radioactive materials

-   Corrosives

-   Miscellaneous dangerous goods, e.g., dry ice, GMOs, and formalin

Below are common non-hazardous materials that you may wish to transport
or ship. Be mindful that just because something is non-hazardous and
does not fall under DOT or IATA regulations does not mean shipment is
regulation free! You may need to consider import and export permits,
research permits, and other regulations. More information is provided
later in the chapter.

### Lab Equipment

Typically there are no restrictions on shipping or transporting lab
equipment, but you should ensure that it has been biologically and
chemically decontaminated before it leaves the lab and ideally attach a
decontamination certification (for more information on decontaminating
equipment see [[Equipment
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit)).

There are some U.S. export restrictions on lab equipment, but primarily
the restrictions are for large-scale bioprocessing, e.g., fermentation
vessels (\> 20 liters), steam sterilizable freeze drying equipment,
Class III biological safety cabinets. We do not anticipate these would
affect community labs, but be sure to check the [[Chemical and
Biological Controls
Division]{.ul}](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/product-guidance/chemical-and-biological-controls)
(CBC) lists if in doubt. You would need to apply for an export license
if you want to ship something on that list outside of the U.S.

### Non-Hazardous Chemicals

If chemicals or reagents are not classified as hazardous under the [[UN
Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous
Goods]{.ul}](https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html)
(e.g., agarose, powdered microbiological media, and some buffer salts),
then they are usually not regulated for transport unless there are
special local regulations.

However, you should still package them securely, ensuring any liquids
will not leak, fully label all items, and include a cover letter with an
itemized list of the package contents. Try to ship all chemicals in
their original packaging. If you have no choice but to repackage into
new containers, then fully label them in such a way that labels cannot
fall off or get obscured in the event of a leak.

### Environmental Samples

Environmental samples (including food and water samples), which are not
considered to pose a significant risk of infection are not regulated,
but you should package them to avoid leaks. We recommend following the
triple-packing method (see [[Packaging and
Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)).

### Non-Infectious, Non-GM Microorganisms

Micro-organisms that are non-GM and not infectious for humans or animals
are not subject to transport regulations. However, they must always be
packaged in such a way that they will not leak in transit so we
recommend that you:

-   Use the triple-packing method (see [[Packaging and
    > Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)).

-   Ensure that full information on the organism and why it is exempt is
    > included in a [[cover
    > letter]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y3knYR1ZBDhF8cGXoXrjPiXgF4ds22oZ)
    > packed between the secondary container and the outer pack.

-   Check permit and GM regulatory requirements for imports and exports
    > if shipping internationally.

### Non-infectious GM Organisms

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) defines GM organisms
as follows:

*Genetically modified microorganisms (GMMOs) and genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) are microorganisms and organisms in which genetic
material has been purposely altered through genetic engineering in a way
that does not occur naturally.*

For ground transport in the U.S., DOT regulations do not apply to any
GMOs unless they are classified as infectious substances, but IATA
regulations cover more scenarios.

For air travel, GM microorganisms which are non-infectious and cannot
"alter animals, plants, or microbiological substances in a way not
normally the result of natural reproduction" are NOT regulated as
dangerous goods by IATA. This includes Risk Group 1 host organisms that
present no significant risks to human, animal, or environmental health
AND contain a non-transmissible vector plasmid that is not able to
modify other organisms. For example, an *E.coli* K-12 derivative
containing a non-transmissible plasmid vector expressing green
fluorescent protein would not fall under transport regulations. However,
you should still:

-   Use the triple-packing method (see [[Packaging and
    > Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)).

-   Ensure that full information on the organism and why it is exempt is
    > included in a [[cover
    > letter]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UBeiDfD9mP5Ac_tgVIDqFNUdr43GtazL)
    > packed between the secondary container and the outer pack.

-   Check permit and GM regulatory requirements for imports and exports
    > if shipping across state lines or internationally.

If the GMO is infectious, then it is classified as a Category A
Biological Substance (UN2814 or UN 2900) or a Category B Biological
Substance (UN3373) and it is subject to regulations based on its
infectious status (see [[Infectious
Substances]{.ul}](#infectious-substances)).

If the GMO is non-infectious but contains a transmissible vector plasmid
or is otherwise able to modify other organisms, then it is classified as
a [[Genetically Modified Organisms
(UN3245)]{.ul}](#genetically-modified-organisms-un3245) and is subject
to regulation,

### DNA, Cell Lines, and Other Biological Materials

DNA, RNA, plasmids (non-infectious), primers, purified proteins, cell
extracts, non-infectious cells (cell-lines) or tissue cultures,
antibodies, and similar materials are typically not regulated for ground
or air transport so long as they:

-   Do not contain infectious substances or substances that are likely
    > to cause disease in humans or animals. Plasmid DNA vectors which
    > require containment level 2 or above for safe handling in the lab
    > must be classified as an infectious substance.

-   Are in a form where any pathogens present have been neutralized or
    > inactivated such that they no longer pose a health risk.

-   Are not toxins.

In all cases you should still:

-   Use the triple-packing method if shipping liquids or agar (see
    > [[Packaging and Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)).

-   Ensure that full information on the organism and why it is exempt is
    > included in a cover letter packed between the secondary container
    > and the outer pack.

-   Check permit and GM regulatory requirements for imports and exports
    > if shipping across state lines or internationally.

### Exempt Human/Animal Specimens

Specimens which have a minimal likelihood of containing pathogens are
classified as "Exempt" from regulation if they are transported by an
IATA courier (or the United States Postal Service). This includes saliva
for DNA testing and many other materials sent for diagnostic tests
unrelated to infectious disease (including, but not limited to, secreta,
excreta, blood, and tissue).

IATA and USPS still require that exempt specimens are properly triple
packaged in the same way as a hazardous biological substance (see
sections below) and the outer packages are clearly marked as "Exempt
Human Specimen" or "Exempt Animal Specimen". USDOT does not require this
labelling for ground transport so check with individual couriers on
their policies.

Shipping and Transporting Hazardous Materials
---------------------------------------------

### Training for Shipping of Hazardous Materials

Any employer or individual who offers a hazardous material for shipment
by air travel must be formally trained in International Air Transport
Association
([[IATA]{.ul}](https://www.iata.org/training/Pages/partner-network.aspx))
regulations. Additionally in the U.S., anyone offering a hazardous
material for shipment by any mode of commercial transportation must be
trained in U.S. Department of Transportation
([[DOT]{.ul}](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/Hazmat_Transportation_Training_Requirements.pdf))
regulations. This requirement also cover anyone undertaking
"pre-transportation activities" such as:

-   Determining the hazard class of a hazardous material.

-   Selecting a hazardous materials packaging.

-   Filling a hazardous materials packaging, including a bulk packaging.

-   Securing a closure on a filled or partially filled hazardous
    > materials package or container or on a package or container
    > containing a residue of a hazardous material.

-   Marking a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous material.

-   Labeling a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous
    > material.

-   Preparing a shipping paper.

Basically, all aspects of offering, preparing for transport, packaging,
or transporting require mandatory certified training:

-   Every 3 years under US DOT regulations.

-   Every 2 years under ICAO/IATA.

-   And as often as the regulations change.

You can find accredited training centres via the International Air
Transport Association
([[IATA]{.ul}](https://www.iata.org/training/Pages/partner-network.aspx))
and U.S. Department of Transportation
([[DOT]{.ul}](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/Hazmat_Transportation_Training_Requirements.pdf)).

Once trained, we highly recommend referring to shipping regulations,
e.g., the IATA [[Purple
Book]{.ul}](https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/index.aspx)
and [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous
Goods]{.ul}](https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html).
These specify requirements for: labeling, packaging materials,
containment (and secondary containment), and restrictions on flights.
Details should still be cross-checked with specific shipping companies
and airlines as policies could differ.

**Shipping Hazardous Biological Materials**
-------------------------------------------

### Infectious Substances

Infectious Substances are substances known to contain, or reasonably
expected to contain, pathogens. Pathogens are defined as microorganisms
(including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, and fungi) and
other agents such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or
animals.

Category A Infectious Substances (including UN2814 Infectious Substance
Affecting Humans & UN2900 Infectious Substance, Affecting Animals) are
capable of causing permanent disability, or life-threatening or fatal
disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. (This roughly
corresponds to Risk Group 3-4.)

Category B Infectious Substances (UN3373) are known or suspected of
containing biological agents that can cause disease, but generally the
disease is treatable and not life threatening with proper medical
intervention. (This roughly corresponds to Risk Group 2.)

As we do not anticipate that community labs will ship any infectious
substances and strongly advise against doing so, no further guidance
will be provided in this chapter.

### Genetically Modified Organisms (UN3245)

If a GMO is not infectious and is not capable of altering animals,
plants, or microbiological substances in a way not normally the result
of natural reproduction, then it is not subject to the provisions of the
regulations (see [[Non-infectious GM
Organisms]{.ul}](#non-infectious-gm-organisms)).

GMOs are only considered hazardous if they fit into one of four IATA
Categories:

1)  Category A infectious substance - Class 6.2 (UN2814 or UN 2900):
    > follow guidelines for this classification as infection status is
    > given priority to GM status.

2)  Meets the definition of Category B Biological Substance - Class 6.2
    > (UN3373): follow guidelines for this classification as infection
    > status is given priority to GM status.

If a GMO does not meet the infectious substance definition but can alter
animals, plants, or microbiological substances in a way not normally the
result of natural reproduction (e.g., *Agrobacterium*), then it is Class
9 (other dangerous goods) UN3245 and should be triple packaged and
labeled as such on the packaging, waybill, and shipping declaration.

Shipping Hazardous Chemical Materials
-------------------------------------

Chemicals or reagents classified as hazardous under the [[UN
Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous
Goods]{.ul}](https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html)
include but are not limited to:

-   Explosives

-   Gases including liquid nitrogen

-   Flammable liquids including alcohol and formaldehyde

-   Flammable solids

-   Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides

-   Toxic and infectious substances infectious agents biological
    > substances

-   Radioactive materials

-   Corrosives

-   Miscellaneous dangerous goods, e.g., dry ice, GMOs, and formalin

We do not recommend shipping any hazardous chemical materials. If you
choose to do so, then remember that the person doing the shipping must
have been DOT-trained to ship hazardous goods in or from the U.S. and
IATA-trained to ship them by air.

A common requirement for community labs might be shipping small
quantities or dry ice or preservatives with biological samples, and we
describe the regulations for this in more detail below. Where possible,
use non-hazardous chemical preservatives such as:

-   10% Formalin (3.75% formaldehyde concentration)

-   Formaldehyde (\<10% concentration of formaldehyde)

-   Phosphate-buffered saline solutions

### Formaldehyde

Formaldehyde solution classifications depend on concentration:

-   \> 25% is shipped as "UN1198, Formaldehyde solutions, flammable, 3,
    > (8), PG III" because it is corrosive and flammable. It is
    > regulated for transport by land and air unless the quantity is \<
    > 30 ml per vial and 500 ml per package, in which case it is
    > excepted from regulation but requires an "[[Excepted Quantities
    > Label]{.ul}](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/sri/shipping-excepted-quantities.page)."

-   10--24.9% is shipped as \"UN3334, Aviation regulated liquid, n.o.s.
    > (Formaldehyde), 9\" when shipped by air but is not regulated by
    > land and may be exempt based on quantity (see above).

-   \<10% or 10% (neutral buffered) formalin (made from a 10:1 dilution
    > of a 37% formaldehyde solution) are not regulated for transport by
    > air or highway. However, courier policies may be inconsistent so
    > check in advance.

For packaging instructions refer to guidance from the [[Federal Aviation
Administration]{.ul}](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/safecargo/how_to_ship/package_for_shipping/),
[[IATA]{.ul}](https://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx),
or
[[DOT]{.ul}](https://www.transportation.gov/check-the-box/getting-started-with-hazmat).

### Ethanol

Ethanol classifications depend on concentration:

-   \>24% is a Class 3 Flammable Liquid unless the quantity is \< 30 ml
    > per vial and 500 ml per package in which case it is excepted from
    > regulation but requires an "[[Excepted Quantities
    > Label]{.ul}](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/sri/shipping-excepted-quantities.page)."

-   \< 24% is not regulated.

The Packing Group (PG) changes as a function of size and indicates level
of danger: PG I = high; PG III = low. Up to 1 liter of ethanol is PG
III; up to 10 liters is PG II.

For packaging instructions refer to guidance from the [[Federal Aviation
Administration]{.ul}](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/safecargo/how_to_ship/package_for_shipping/),
[[IATA]{.ul}](https://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/index.aspx),
or
[[DOT]{.ul}](https://www.transportation.gov/check-the-box/getting-started-with-hazmat).

### Dry Ice

For very sensitive biological materials, you may need to ship at very
low temperatures on dry ice.

![](media/image31.jpg){width="1.7239588801399826in"
height="1.7239588801399826in"}

There are strict labeling requirements: the outside of the box should be
labeled with a hazard class 9 label, UN 1845, and net weight of dry ice
in kilograms.

The label should be affixed to a vertical side of the box (not the top
or bottom) and oriented vertically with the stripes on the top of the
label. The airbill (air waybill) must also include the statement:

"Dry ice, 9, UN 1845, \[number of packages\] X \[net weight\] in kg"

There are other important considerations for packing with dry ice:

-   Dry ice sublimes; it changes directly from a solid to a gas
    > releasing large volumes of carbon dioxide. One kilogram of dry ice
    > produces 540 liters of carbon dioxide gas! Packages containing dry
    > ice must not be tightly sealed to allow gas to escape and prevent
    > build-up of pressure. Avoid using containers with an airtight seal
    > such as a jar with a threaded lid or a plastic cooler, and never
    > seal the outer box completely with plastic packing tape.

-   Carbon dioxide gas is colorless and odorless, and if enough dry ice
    > were to sublime in an unventilated space, it could lead to several
    > side effects and eventually asphyxiation. If you are transporting
    > dry ice ice in a vehicle, it should never be in the same air space
    > as the driver, i.e., it can only be transported in a van or lorry
    > with a separate cabin.

-   Dry ice is very cold, and not all materials are rated for
    > temperatures as low as -86°C. Do not use plastics that can be
    > rendered brittle or permeable by low temperatures.

-   Be mindful of weight limits for dry ice. The [[Federal Aviation
    > Administration]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration)
    > in the U.S. allows airline passengers to carry up to 2.5 kg (5.5
    > lb) per person either as [[checked
    > baggage]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checked_baggage) or
    > carry-on baggage.

-   Secure your samples in such a way that when the dry ice sublimates,
    > they will still be secure inside the box and not move about.

-   Minimize the volume of air space in the box to slow the rate of dry
    > ice sublimation.

-   Shipments are generally recommended to contain 2-4.5 kg of dry ice
    > per 24 hours to ensure that they stay cold all the way to their
    > destination.

Shipping Documentation
----------------------

Before sending any biological materials abroad, the person sending the
goods (the consignor/shipper) should contact the person to whom they are
being sent (the consignee) to let them know shipping details and to
check that the substance may be legally imported. The person receiving
the materials is generally regarded as the importer and the one
responsible for obtaining, where necessary, all appropriate permits or
licences. Importation of materials into the U.S. is particularly tightly
regulated and there are restrictions even on some items that may be
transported as non-dangerous goods. In contrast, very few items require
any sort of import permit, licence, or notification to be made when
importing into the UK. Any carriage of goods subject to controls under
the transport regulations must be accompanied by documentation as
specified in those regulations. The information required must be clearly
legible and for air transport must exactly meet the specified format.
The following includes requirements for paperwork included within the
package and for paperwork accompanying the package for the carrier, etc.

When transporting any biological materials, paperwork must be included
within the package between the secondary container and the outer
container (attached to the secondary), givingthe names and addresses of
both the consignor (sender) and consignee (receiver), including
emergency contact details (name and telephone number) at both ends. or
dangerous goods, a description of the goods in the following
format/order UN NUMBER and PROPER SHIPPING NAME. In addition, for
Category A infectious substances assigned to UN 2814 or UN 2900, tThe
proper shipping name must be supplemented with the technical name (the
recognized biological/scientific/technical name of the micro-organism).

When the infectious substances to be transported are unknown but
suspected of meeting the criteria for inclusion in Category A and
assignment to UN 2814 or UN 2900, the words \"suspected Category A
infectious substance\" in parentheses should be used as the technical
name. An itemized list of contents must be given, to include for each
named item the number of tubes and their volume, or for exempt human or
animal specimens, a simple statement saying what the materials are, that
there is minimal likelihood that pathogens are present, and that they
are exempted under the transport regulations. For non-hazardous
biological materials, a simple statement saying what the materials are,
that they are non-hazardous, and that they are not classified as
dangerous goods under the transport regulations should be provided.

Written emergency response procedures must also be provided with any
package containing biological materials classified under UN 2814, UN
2900, UN 3373, or UN 3245. When using a courier, senders must always
give a full description of the goods to the company when initially
arranging the shipment, including the relevant UN number(s) and proper
shipping name(s), in order that the courier is fully aware they will be
transporting dangerous goods and ensures the necessary paperwork is
completed. For transport by road of packages containing dangerous goods
other than those assigned to UN 3373 as Category B infectious
substances, the carrier (company transporting the goods) should request
that a dangerous goods declaration form be completed. Typically the
carrier will provide a copy of the form for completion. For transport by
air of packages containing dangerous goods, it is necessary to complete
an Air Waybill and, in most cases, a Shipper\'s Declaration for
Dangerous Goods.

All packages must include the following documentation inside the
package, between the secondary container and outer package (see
[[Packaging and Containment]{.ul}](#packaging-and-containment)):

-   A full packing list of all items, with any hazardous goods codes and
    > explanations for exemption from regulation.

-   A cover letter from the shipper to the recipient detailing why the
    > material is being sent and any additional information about the
    > end use (e.g. for research and/or education only).

-   Copies of any permits required (ideally more than one copy).

-   Full contact details for the shipper including emergency contact
    > telephone number. IATA and USDOT require that the emergency
    > response contact is immediately available 24-hours to provide
    > technical information and emergency response guidance.

-   Shippers declarations required by the courier.

For international shipments:

-   Copies of any permits or import/export certificates required
    > (ideally more than one copy).

-   A customs invoice detailing what the materials are and the
    > harmonized customs code the products fall under.

-   A certificate of origin (optional---required to clear customs in
    > some countries).

The outside of the box should have:

-   All necessary shipping labels.

-   Copies of any permits and import/export certificates.

-   Full contact details for the shipper including emergency contact
    > telephone number.

-   Full address details for the recipient.

Not including the correct documentation could severely delay your
shipment or result in fines so always consult with the courier or postal
service to ensure you have provided everything required.

Packaging and Containment
-------------------------

All packaging used for shipping materials should be sturdy, durable, and
resistant to crushing. Biological materials must be packaged according
to the triple packaging principle. The three elements of triple
packaging include: primary receptacle, leak-proof secondary container,
and durable outer container.

Firstly, we cover the formats to package common biological materials
that may be exchanged between community labs.

### Packaging DNA Plasmids

Plasmids (circular pieces of DNA) are one of the easiest ways to store
and transfer DNA and are commonly available across many different labs.
Plasmid stocks can be dried down in a tube, spotted on paper, kept in
solution, or hosted in a cell. The format for storage should dictate the
circumstances for storage, labeling, or shipping.

**Liquid in a tube:** Ensure that plasmids are not allowed to escape the
storage medium by spillage. The tube should be sealed with parafilm,
wrapped in absorbent material sufficient to absorb all of the liquid,
and sealed inside a secondary plastic container, e.g., a Falcon tube or
sealable plastic storage box, and wrapped inside a thick plastic bag.
All shipping boxes and outer containers should be sturdy enough to
prevent the container from being crushed.

**Dried in a tube:** Ensure that the pellet will not get lost in the
environment. The tube should be sealed inside a thick plastic bag and a
secondary plastic container, e.g., a Falcon tube or sealable plastic
storage box. All shipping boxes and outer containers should be sturdy
enough to prevent the container inside from being crushed.

**Spotted and dried on sterile filter paper:** Wrap the paper in sterile
aluminum foil, and place in a sealable bag inside a padded envelope
before shipping. See
[[here]{.ul}](http://wang.ucsd.edu/protocol/2.%20molecular%20cloning/2.3%20Amplification/Shipping_and_Receiving_Plasmids_on_Filter_Paper.pdf)
and
[[here]{.ul}](https://bitesizebio.com/394/sending-plasmids-how-to-avoid-jail-time-and-shredded-envelopes/)
for protocols for preparing, shipping, and receiving plasmids dried on
paper.

**Inside bacteria:** Make a "bacterial stab" by filling a screw-cap
plastic or glass tube approximately one-third full of appropriate agar
media. See
[[here]{.ul}](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~santosr/protocols/EcolStabAgarProtocol.pdf)
for protocol for preparing a stab.

Where possible, we recommend shipping plasmids spotted onto paper as
this method is easiest, lightest, and least likely to result in breakage
of containers.

### Packaging Bacterial Strains

**Spotted on sterile filter paper:** Wrap the paper in sterile aluminum
foil, and place in a sealable bag inside a padded envelope before
shipping. See
[[here]{.ul}](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/koshland/Protocols/YEAST/sendstrains.html)
and [[here]{.ul}](https://cgsc2.biology.yale.edu/StrainShip.php) for
protocols for preparing strains.

**As an agar stab:** Make a "bacterial stab" by filling a screw-cap
plastic or glass tube approximately one-third full of appropriate agar
media. See
[[here]{.ul}](http://webhome.auburn.edu/~santosr/protocols/EcolStabAgarProtocol.pdf)
for protocol for preparing a stab.

Where possible, we recommend shipping strains spotted onto paper as this
method is easiest, lightest, and least likely to result in breakage of
containers.

### Primary Containment

The primary container is the one that holds the biological material; it
must be leak proof and labeled with the name of the contents.

Leak proof means that it needs to be sealed such as a heat seal, a
crimp, or a reusable seal (like a resealable freezer bag). If the
container is a screw-top it should be secured with waterproof tape
(e.g., Parafilm, etc.).

Place absorbent material between the primary and secondary receptacles,
using enough material to absorb the entire contents of all primary
receptacles. Absorbent material is required for Biological Substance,
Category B (UN 3373) shipments containing liquids. Acceptable absorbent
materials include cellulose wadding, cotton balls, super-absorbent
packets, and paper towels.

### Secondary Containment

Secondary containment is a container that contains any spills or leaks
and/or protects the material from moisture that might penetrate the
packaging and other damage. The secondary container must be chemically
compatible with any chemical being shipped such that it will not melt or
degrade upon exposure. Most secondary containers are plastic and could
include a plastic bag, box, or tube that is sealed.

### Outer Packaging

The outer container must be rigid and have one side that is at least 100
mm X 100 mm, in order for required markings and labels to fit. The outer
package must be of adequate strength for its capacity, mass, and
intended use.

Outer packing materials should ideally be new and clean and could
include cardboard, paper, bubble wrap, foams, and other materials to
ensure that the material is well wrapped and protected during transport.
Do not use packing material that is derived from natural materials such
as grasses or fibers as they may harbour insects and seeds and be
prohibited from import in some regions. If you reuse and recycle
packaging, then make sure all previous labeling is removed or completely
obscured.

Use rigid outer packaging constructed of corrugated fiberboard, wood,
metal, or plastic, or other equally strong material, including cylinders
made of such materials and appropriately sized for the contents.
Chipboard or paperboard boxes are unacceptable outer packaging. The
completed packaging must be of good quality, strong enough to withstand
the normal rigors of transportation without loss of contents as a result
of vibration, changes in temperature, humidity, or pressure.

### Packaging to Keep Shipments Cool

If you need to transport materials at 4°C or below, use frozen foam or
plastic coolers rather than wet ice (i.e., ice cubes or flaked ice),
which could melt and leak from the packaging.

Always select cooling materials that are a good size and shape to fit
into your box and surround the material. Note that any cooled package
will sweat or eventually become wet due to water condensing on the
surface cooling packs so you should seal the inner package to prevent
condensing water getting out, and also enclose the material in a
waterproof secondary containment like a sealed plastic bag, container,
or box to prevent it from getting wet.

For transport materials at -80°C, see the [[Dry Ice]{.ul}](#dry-ice-1)
section above.

Always check with your shipping company on their policies and guidance
for cooled packages.

Format for Shipping Common Biological Materials
-----------------------------------------------

### Labeling Hazardous Materials

#### Shipper and Consignee Information

Make sure that labeling is clear and will remain intact and legible
throughout the shipping process. Ideally use printed rather than
handwritten labels and be sure to have another instance of the
recipient\'s address on the package in case the first is smudged,
ripped, or missing in transit. You should include:

-   Complete name, address, and phone number of the shipper.

-   Complete name and address of the consignee.

If you are reusing boxes it is important to remove any previous labels
from the box or deface them so the label is completely covered.
Especially barcodes as your package will be scanned in and out of depots
on its way.

#### Labeling the Contents of the Package

Inside the package, the material should be labeled with all relevant
information about the sample or chemical. Ideally chemicals and reagents
should be in their original packaging with the markings from the
manufacturer.

#### Hazard Warning Labels

In addition to shipping labels, the container should be labeled with any
hazard warning symbols or UN codes and pictograms where applicable. This
is needed for shippers to identify packages that need to be accounted
for on shipments or segregated from others. The major ones you are
likely to encounter are discussed below.

Permits and Import/Export Regulations 
-------------------------------------

### Invasive Organisms Concerns (Fungus, Bacteria, Insects, etc.)

Causing the spread of invasive species is one of the greatest concerns
when transferring organisms. While most lab organisms have mutations
that make them weakened versions of a wildtype strain, this doesn't
preclude dangers to the environment. Lack of natural selection
(predators or disease) or the introduction of disease can have
catastrophic effects on the environment. Every effort should be made to
reduce risks to the environment and contamination of samples.

**Do:**

-   Use clean new cardboard, paper, bubble wrap, and foam

-   Reisolate and confirm materials

-   Take materials from the original frozen stock

**Don't:**

-   Mislabel samples

-   Use natural packing materials as they may carry invasive organisms
    > such as seeds, fungus, or insects

-   Don't transport live soil, plant material, or other environmental
    > samples

### Import Permits (e.g., USDA)

Many materials and organisms require additional import/export permits
for obtaining the material, transferring it, using it for research, or
all three.

In the U.S. and other countries, these permits might be needed at
different levels from the very local to the national. This is a
complicated area, so don't be afraid to reach out to agencies and ask
questions about what to do. Consider the need for the following if you
are importing biological materials across state or national lines:

-   Research permits (state, federal county, city or locality).

-   Federal or state or location-specific permit for collection (e.g., a
    > Federal Park permit or a fishery permit from
    > [[NOAA]{.ul}](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/node/22686)).

-   Agriculture plants or animals permit (see
    > [[USDA]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/permits)
    > or and [[European
    > Commission]{.ul}](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/info_permits_en.htm)
    > guidance).

-   Biosafety Level Permit or equivalent (usually a county or city in
    > the
    > [[U.S]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/nahems_guidelines/fadprep_nahems_guidelines_biosecurity.pdf).,
    > national in Europe).

-   Hazardous Chemicals/Waste permit (search for requirements at state,
    > county, Ppovince, or city level).

### List of Important U.S. Regulations

The following regulations apply to the packaging and shipment of
biological materials:

-   U.S. Department of Transportation, 49 CFR Parts 171-180 and
    > amendments

-   U.S. Public Health Service, 42 CFR Part 72, Interstate Shipment of
    > Etiologic Agents

-   U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health
    > Administration, 29 CFR Part 1910.1030, Bloodborne Pathogens

-   International Air Transport Association (IATA), Dangerous Goods
    > Regulations

-   U.S. Postal Service, 39 CFR Part 111, Mailability of Etiologic
    > Agents, Mailability of Sharps and Other Medical Devices, and
    > Publication 52, Acceptance of Hazardous, Restricted or Perishable
    > Matter

-   International Civil Aviation Organization, Technical Instructions
    > for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air

-   United Nations, Recommendations of the Committee of Experts on the
    > Transportation of Dangerous Goods

All North American airlines and FedEx, the largest shipper of infectious
materials, use the IATA regulation (also referred to as the Dangerous
Goods Regulation or DGR) as their standard. Meeting the conditions of
this standard will ensure meeting the provisions of the other U.S.
regulations.

12. Waste Disposal
==================

### Why Is Waste Disposal Important?

Waste generation, storage, and disposal should be given consideration in
every experiment because a good amount of the waste from laboratory
experiments is hazardous. Be aware of the laws that regulate waste
disposal. Included here is an overview of the disposal of hazardous,
biological, and other common types of waste generated in community
biology labs.

Waste Regulation
----------------

### Legal Duty of Care

Waste regulations vary by country and often by state or local
jurisdiction. For example, the EU and the UK\'s Environmental Protection
Acts includes a "Duty of Care" for all persons involved in the handling
of waste, including producers.

In such cases waste producers must take reasonable and appropriate
measures to ensure that:

-   Waste is only stored, treated, deposited or disposed of in
    > accordance with a waste management licence or other authorization.

-   Waste does not escape from the control of the holder (Chain of
    > Custody).

-   Waste is only transferred to authorized persons such as registered
    > waste carriers or licensed operators permitted to accept that type
    > of waste.

-   All transfers and movements of the waste are accompanied by an
    > adequate written description of the waste, which will allow waste
    > to be identified and subsequently handled correctly (Chain of
    > Custody).

The duty begins with the person who generates the waste, and it cannot
be delegated to others. This duty is legally enforceable. Violations can
lead to criminal prosecution of individuals and community labs.

While the regulations differ across jurisdictions, the "duty of care"
principles are international best practice. Consequently, community lab
members must make every effort to categorize, segregate, and contain
waste according to standards imposed by these practices and in
accordance with the current legislation in their location.

### Other Waste Regulations

In the U.S., waste disposal is regulated by the EPA and state and local
governments. Hazardous waste disposal information can be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-basics-hazardous-waste) and
in the [[EPA handbook on Hazardous Waste Hazardous Generator
Regulations]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/tool2012_0.pdf).
Check your local waste regulations to further understand your
responsibility as a waste generator.

Many regulations for pollution control have strict management and
documentation procedures. These requirements can only be met by
following procedures to segregate hazardous wastes from the greater bulk
of less harmful materials. Mixing hazardous wastes should be avoided at
all times.

Waste must be properly described and appropriate handling precautions
noted. The description must be sufficient to ensure that subsequent
holders of the waste are able to avoid mishandling it. The description
should contain information about the source of the waste, what it is
made up of, how it is produced, and details of any special problems
which may be encountered by handling the waste. Waste containers must be
correctly labeled, robust, and chemically resistant.

### Waste Hierarchy

The UK government\'s waste hierarchy is a useful framework to encourage
minimization of waste and good recycling practices. This hierarchy is
designed as follows:

-   Reduce the amount of waste produced

-   Re-use the material where possible

-   Recycle the material where possible

-   Recover any component parts or materials

-   Dispose as the last resort

Due to the chemical and biological contamination of waste emerging from
labs, extra attention should be paid to the first step in the hierarchy:
reducing the amount of waste produced in the first place through good
planning and procurement practices.

Waste Management
----------------

The minimization and disposal of waste has become one of the most
significant environmental issues in lab practice. The disposal of waste
can have a significant impact on the environment, especially as the
total volume of available landfill is decreasing. By ensuring effective
waste management, the community lab will:

-   Ensure compliance with all current environmental legislation

-   Reduce the costs associated with waste disposal

-   Enhance the reputation of the community lab

-   Reduce the amount of material sent to landfill by adopting the
    > reduce, re-use, recover, and recycle ethos

-   Improve the working environment for community lab members

-   Reduce the environmental, health, and safety risks to which lab
    > members and visitors are exposed

All waste must be labeled as hazardous waste. The composition of the
waste must be clearly noted with a label or on the side of the
container, appropriate for its storage. Waste can be stored in a
Satellite Accumulation Area (SAA) until the disposal date as allowed by
local regulations. An SAA is an area away from the main work location
where a larger amount of waste can be stored. In some countries waste
needs to be disposed of regularly once accumulation starts. In other
countries, the waste can accumulate until the container is full. Check
local laws for more information.

There can be some restrictions on the type and size of the container for
storage (e.g., it must be suitable for the type and composition of the
wastes). Hazardous waste containers must be stored in a secondary
containment, capable of holding the contents of the primary container in
the event of a leak or spill. Ensure that all waste containers are
labeled with their waste composition along with the owner's name when
applicable.

### Waste Management Best Practices in a Community Lab

-   Community labs should aim to minimize their environmental impact as
    > much as possible. Each laboratory member must dispose of
    > biological and chemical waste safely, and recycle glass, plastic
    > and recyclable metals and devices whenever possible.

-   In encouraging learning and collaboration within scientific and
    > engineering projects, each community lab member should execute
    > carefully planned projects with minimal environmental impact.

-   Community labs must comply fully with environmental legislation and
    > approved best management practices, and make continued efforts to
    > minimize waste and pollution and to operate effective waste
    > management procedures.

-   Every member of the community lab must be trained in correct
    > disposal of different types of waste before they start projects in
    > order to minimize danger to themselves, other members, and
    > volunteers and the environment.

-   Lab managers should consider providing an email to answer questions
    > about policy and waste disposal practices.

-   Create a process for the laboratory members to determine, document,
    > and setup waste streams for biological or chemical waste generated
    > in an experiment.

-   Provide clear signage about where to dispose of waste around the
    > lab.

-   Conduct risk assessments of projects for safety concerns, especially
    > those involving hazardous chemicals. Make this mandatory for
    > membership and required when their research changes scope or they
    > require a hazardous chemical for the experiment (review the
    > [[BioCurious project disclosure
    > form]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m6DPgDGgW-tf0cOm2QgBujZyIWTvIAuQTZgm0FZtQjc/edit?usp=drive_web)).

-   Determine the owners of any chemicals and label containers with the
    > owner's name.

### Recycling 

Community labs should designate recycling containers and collection
routes for plastic, glass, aluminium, batteries, paper, and cardboard.
Be sure to identify and use nearby, local collection points and arrange
for the regular removal of accumulated recyclable waste. New community
lab members should be provided recycling guidelines as part of their
induction process.

Some glass and plastic containers can be recycled. Do not recycle
bottles that held a hazardous chemical. For containers that held
non-hazardous chemicals, these can be washed and recycled, but be sure
to fully remove their labels.

### Waste Incidents

Anyone involved in an incident concerning waste handling or disposal
should document the incident and provide the information to leadership
of the community lab. This information is needed to ensure that the
details of the incident are recorded including what was spilled, how it
was dealt with, if anyone was injured, and if any resources need
replacing (incident report form examples from
[[Genspace]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing)
and
[[FEMA]{.ul}](https://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/assets/ICS%20Forms//ICS%20Form%20209,%20Incident%20Status%20Summary%20(v3).pdf)).
Waste management incident records should be reviewed by community lab
members in an effort to improve training and onboarding procedures for
new members.

Waste Classification
--------------------

### Definition of Waste

In the UK, the legal definition of waste is "any substance or object
which the producer or the person in possession of it discards or intends
or is required to discard." Within the terms of this definition, the
producer is anyone whose activities produce waste or who carries out
pre-processing, mixing, or other operations resulting in a change in its
nature or composition.

### Controlled Waste

Controlled waste applies to waste from households, commerce, or
industry, excluding waste from agricultural premises, waste from mines
and quarries, explosives, and radioactive waste. Therefore, the majority
of waste from community labs is classified as controlled waste.

### Biological Waste

All biological waste (GM and non-GM) should be inactivated by
autoclaving or immersion in an appropriate disinfectant (e.g., 1%
Virkon, 10% bleach) before leaving the community lab. Or a specialist
waste disposal company should be contracted to collect the biological
waste. See [[Working with
Microbes]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8)
and this [[primer on
disinfection]{.ul}](http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Disinfection/Assets/Disinfection101.pdf)
for more information on deactivating microorganisms. Many community
biology labs contract with a local medical waste disposal company for
their biological waste.

Autoclave waste should be collected within the laboratory in clear
autoclave bags, separate from general waste. Waste which has been
inactivated by autoclaving and is not contaminated with hazardous
chemicals should then be disposed of according to local regulations. In
many places, this can enter the standard landfill stream as
non-hazardous waste, but always check local regulations for guidance.

Click [[here]{.ul}](https://youtu.be/rM_JTgLSKXk) or
[[here]{.ul}](https://youtu.be/T901F2W7wks) for a training video on
autoclaves.

While self-treating wastes is one option for labs that only have small
amounts, this might also require some additional regulation on the
method. While localities allow waste to be autoclaved and disposed of,
in some areas autoclaves must be properly certified and regularly
verified using a spore test such as using the [[ATTEST spore test from
3M]{.ul}](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/All-3M-Products/Health-Care/Medical/Attest/?N=5002385+8707795+8707798+8711017+8711714+3294857497&rt=r3).
(More information on autoclaving practices and how to test and verify an
autoclave from the CDC
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/sterilizing-practices.html).)

In the U.S., some biological waste is considered "regulated medical
waste," and the [[definitions vary by
state]{.ul}](http://www.hercenter.org/rmw/rmwtypes.php). In some areas,
regulated medical waste and waste from recombinant DNA experiments must
be disposed of using a certified waste hauler for final decontamination
and disposal. While this service can be expensive and only serve
commercial locations or urban areas, it can be an alternative when waste
volumes increase. Please be aware that many of these have restrictive
contracts and can be multi-year agreements with financial penalties so
approach any contract with caution.

Some examples of medical waste haulers include (these are not
endorsements but for general information):

-   [[Cannon
    > Hygiene]{.ul}](https://www.cannonhygiene.com/services/clinical-medical-dental/clinical-waste)

### Clinical Waste

Clinical waste includes the disposal of any waste which consists of or
is contaminated with human or animal tissue, blood, or other bodily
fluids or secretions, drugs or other pharmaceutical products, swabs or
dressings, syringes, needles, or other sharp instruments. This includes
any other waste arising from medical, nursing, dental, veterinary,
pharmaceutical or similar practice, investigation, treatment, care,
teaching, research, or blood transfusion.

Most community labs are rated for Biosafety Level One (BSL-1)
containment. Refer to [[Biological
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit#heading=h.o5m4y9nt1dkx)
for more information. In general, at BSL-1, there should be no
procedures that produce clinical waste. However, from time to time,
projects are approved in community labs that involve animal cell
culture, use of non-insect animal tissues, use of human cheek cells, or
saliva samples that have risks of transmitting human pathogens. These
should be inactivated prior to disposal. Follow the procedures outlined
above for biological waste.

### Hazardous Waste

Put simply, a hazardous waste is a material with properties that make it
dangerous or capable of harming humans or the environment if not
properly managed. Making the determination of whether a waste is
hazardous is complicated and requires an extensive understanding of the
waste constituents, how it was generated, the material's chemical and
physical characteristics, and the applicable regulations.

Chemical waste (including out of date chemicals, any chemicals withdrawn
from use, unwanted materials, etc.) must be disposed of properly.
Chemical wastes should be identified with the name of the chemical(s)
being disposed, the approximate quantity, and a reference to the Safety
Data Sheet. A suitable and certified provider to dispose of chemical
waste must be identified for the laboratory.

Hazardous wastes also vary by country. In the UK, items classified as
hazardous waste include CRT monitors and fluorescent light tubes. This
type of waste includes the disposal of any substances classified,
marked, or known to be explosive, oxidising, flammable, toxic, harmful,
irritant, corrosive, dangerous to the environment, a poison, or
classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, or ecotoxic.
Guidance on whether a waste should be classified as hazardous can
initially be found at: [[http://www.environment-
agency.gov.uk/subjects/waste/]{.ul}](http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subjects/waste/).

In the U.S., the regulatory requirements for determining whether a waste
is a hazardous waste are made by answering the following questions:

-   Is the material excluded from the definition of solid or hazardous
    > waste?

-   Is the material exempted from regulation?

-   Is the waste listed as a hazardous waste in the United States
    > Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) regulations?

-   Does the waste exhibit one or more of the four hazardous
    > characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or
    > toxicity?

-   Is the material a [[state-regulated
    > waste]{.ul}](http://www.retailcrc.org/RegGuidance/rcracompliance/Pages/default.aspx)?

A material is considered to be a hazardous waste if it appears on the
U.S. EPA [[list of hazardous
wastes]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/hw/defining-hazardous-waste-listed-characteristic-and-mixed-radiological-wastes)
or exhibits a hazardous characteristic. Two methods can be used to
determine if the waste exhibits hazardous characteristics: testing or
applying generator knowledge.

-   Testing must be done following strict regulatory protocols
    > established by the U.S. EPA.

-   [[Generator
    > knowledge]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/frequent-questions-about-implementing-hazardous-waste-generator-improvements-final-rule#determinations)
    > involves applying an understanding of the hazardous nature or
    > characteristics of the waste based on the materials or processes
    > used to generate the waste.

You can find more information about the disposal of waste in the UK by
visiting the following website:
[[https://www.gov.uk/dispose-hazardous-waste]{.ul}](https://www.gov.uk/dispose-hazardous-waste);
or by finding a local waste disposal agent in the EU:
[[http://www.hazardouswasteeurope.eu/members/]{.ul}](http://www.hazardouswasteeurope.eu/members/).

#### Very Small Quantity Generators (VSQG) Programs (U.S.)

In the U.S., many cities and towns will accept hazardous waste for
disposal. In order for your lab to dispose of your waste this way. you
may be classified as a Very Small Quantity Generator (VSQG). Very Small
Quantity Generators (VSQGs) generate less than 100 kilograms per month
of hazardous waste or less than one kilogram per month of acutely
hazardous waste. The VSQG program may help small businesses deal with
hazardous waste. Check with your local city, state, or country for more
specific guidance.

To apply for the U.S. EPA VSQG program, follow these steps. They are
easy, fast, inexpensive, and can help prevent expensive fines.

1)  Apply for a local EPA permit.

2)  Describe the hazardous waste you will be generating.

3)  Make an appointment for dropping off your waste.

4)  Head to the appointment with your paperwork, pay the fee, (most are
    > drive in style so you don't even need to get out of your car).

5)  Keep the paperwork for audits in the future.

*For information on the EPA VSGQ program or Small Quantity Generators
[[click
here]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/categories-hazardous-waste-generators).
More helpful information can be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/k01005.pdf)*

and
[[here.]{.ul}](http://www.retailcrc.org/RegGuidance/rcracompliance/Pages/default.aspx)*

While VSQG is a terrific program, it is not the solution for everyone or
for certain acutely toxic chemicals. Prior to using a chemical or
starting an experiment that will generate waste, we suggest
investigating the disposal requirements and costs; or use a different
chemical or method to achieve similar results.

Many cities hold regular waste disposal events to collect household
hazardous waste. Consider utilizing this service for one-off disposal
needs.

Pouring Waste Down the Drain
----------------------------

Drain disposal regulations vary by locality or municipality and effluent
can be monitored by local authorities. As inexperienced individuals may
be present in the lab, post a list of key substances that should not be
disposed of into the drains including:

-   Biological waste (e.g., non-GM organisms that might damage the
    > plumbing)

-   Live GM organisms (e.g., transformed/transfected cells, transgenic
    > organisms, or genome-edited organism)

-   Clinical waste

-   Concentrated or stock chemical waste (local regulations and Safety
    > Data Sheets should be consulted for guidelines on storage and
    > disposal of chemicals. In general assume that chemicals, even
    > dilute chemicals, cannot be put down the sink until you have
    > checked)

-   Dry ice (unlike wet ice this should *never* be placed into drains as
    > it can damage pipework)

-   Sharps and broken glass---dispose of in designated sharps bins

-   Molten or solid agar

-   Antibiotic stocks or media with antibiotics

-   Drug or other pharmaceuticals (including plant hormones)

Common Waste Beyond Chemicals
-----------------------------

### Batteries

Many batteries are classified as hazardous waste. This is because they
contain corrosive materials such as sulphuric acid or potassium
hydroxide, as well as heavy metals such as cadmium and lead. Some can be
explosive under certain conditions. Community labs should determine the
best location to recycle or dispose of batteries.

Some possible routes for recycling these include:

-   Household hazardous waste programs

-   Battery recycling programs for Li, lead acid

-   Some local city/state agencies will collect batteries (i.e., fire
    > departments, universities, recycling centers, etc.)

-   Place of sale often have battery recycling programs

### Aluminum Cans

Drink cans made from aluminum or other recyclable metals should be
disposed of in designated recycling bins. Drinks cans should not be
taken into community labs.

### Cardboard

Community labs acquire many cardboard boxes every week. Thus, they
should develop procedures to reuse and recycle cardboard and paper as
much as possible. A recycling bin should be identified for the lab.

### Electrical/Electronic Equipment (E-waste)

Surplus electrical and electronic equipment may be donated to community
labs. When disposal is necessary (e.g., the equipment is broken or
unwanted), the equipment should be:

-   Collected separately from other waste

-   Decontaminated if necessary

-   Passed to a suitable recycling contractor

-   Treated and disposed in an environmentally sound way

Some localities have instituted regulations which require proper
disposal and could result in a fine if not followed. Many localities
have added E-waste collection services. Check with you local waste
hauler and waste recycler for more information.

Whenever possible, all data and licensed software should be removed
prior to collection. Any reusable equipment is refurbished and
remarketed by the contractor. Any unusable equipment should be
disassembled for recovery of component materials (e.g., metals, glass,
and plastic). All other electrical and electronic waste should be
decontaminated prior to collection.

### Fluorescent Tubes

Fluorescent tubes, spent ultraviolet (UV) tubes, and mercury and sodium
lamps are classified as hazardous waste. Broken or faulty lamps and
tubes must be collected and disposed of according to local regulations.
Many household hazardous waste programs specifically deal with these
bulbs and have recycling programs. In addition many retailers that sell
these products offer recycling.

### Glass

Recycling bins for glass can be provided in the community lab. However,
many glass products and bottles used in the lab cannot be recycled. For
example, window glass, tumblers, and Pyrex glassware are unable to be
recycled and should not be placed in recycling bins. Depending on the
chemical or biological contents, the glass may need to go directly to
hazardous/biological waste instead of recycling. Check with the safety
data sheet associated with the glass container and your safety officer
for more information.

Other glass products will need to be cleaned prior to recycling. Where
bottles have contained highly flammable solvents (flash point less than
21°C), any remaining solvent must be disposed of as hazardous chemical
waste. The bottle(s) should then be rinsed out with acetone (acetone
washings must be disposed of as hazardous chemical waste) and washed out
with water. Fill the bottle(s) to the brim with water (to drive out
vapour), and empty the bottle in the sink. Invert the bottle (neck
downwards) on a drying rack in a well-ventilated area until it is dry
and any remaining vapours have vented. Deface the label and place the
bottle either in a glass-recycling bin or in the general trash bin.

Broken glass is a special category of waste which might be chemically or
biologically contaminated. Broken glass should be treated as
[[sharps]{.ul}](#sharps) with a special disposal container depending on
contamination. These sharps containers may be considered hazardous
waste.

### Sharps

All sharps should be placed into a "sharps container." Sharps should be
disposed of as clinical and biological waste. However, if the needles
have been used to purely transfer chemicals within a laboratory
environment and have not come into contact with biological agents, they
should be considered chemical waste. However, they should still be
placed into sharps containers after use.

Glass microscope slides and coverslips and broken or used glass pipettes
should be placed in designated contaminated glass or sharps bins in the
community lab and should not be recycled. Medical waste service
providers, described above, often offer pickup of sharps bins for
disposal.

### Paper

Paper waste should be sorted into appropriate recycling collection bins
in the community lab. These bins should be emptied at least weekly or
sooner if full. Be aware that paper and cardboard can present a fire
hazard. Do not allow the overfilling of bins, as this increases the risk
of fire as well as becoming a handing issue due to its weight.
Confidential waste paper should be disposed via shredding or through a
local disposal company.

### Plastic

Plastics should be collected along with other recycling and be disposed
in appropriate recycling bins (depending on the availability of
recycling facilities in your location). If recycling plastic is an
option, be aware that only types 1, 2 and 3 plastics are commonly
recycled:

-   Type 1: PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) Soft drink and water
    > bottles.

-   Type 2: PE-HD (High-Density Polyethylene) Milk bottles, juice
    > bottles, shampoo bottles, chemical and detergent bottles, buckets
    > and rigid detergent bottles.

-   Type 3: PVC-U (Unplasticised Polyvinyl Chloride) Cosmetic containers
    > and mineral water bottles.

The number identifying the type of plastic can normally be found on the
base of the item.

Please be aware that the plastic wafers and racks that come with
disposable pipettes can be recycled in some areas. The tip and wafers
are ground down into polypropylene pellets and used again.

### Refrigerators

Depending on your local/national laws, the refrigerant in your cooling
systems (refrigerators) may need to be collected before disposal.

In the UK, the Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation 2037/2000 requires
the removal of CFCs and HCFCs from the insulation foam as well as from
the cooling circuit. This requirement also applies to industrial,
commercial, and domestic appliances.

Also, in the UK, redundant fridges are now classified as hazardous waste
and must not be disposed of unless the refrigerant has been removed from
the cooling system and the insulation foam. A contractor should be
consulted to dispose of these items. Similar legislation applies to the
U.S. and other locations. Check with your local laws and waste haulers
for more information.

### Toner and Ink Cartridges

Toner and ink cartridges should be recycled. Contact the cartridge
manufacturer for recycling instructions; often charities collect these
to sell for income.

### Miscellaneous Laboratory and Office Furniture

Where possible, surplus furniture should be sold or donated to another
user (once decontaminated if necessary).

### Radioactive Waste

In general, most community labs will not approve experiments using
radioactivity, and therefore radioactive reagents and equipment should
not be brought on to the premises. Radioactive waste management involves
dealing safely with the long-lived wastes from processes involving
radioactivity. All radioactive uses are highly regulated to protect both
human health and the environment. An example of specific governmental
guidelines for radiation are available
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/radioactive-substances-regulation-for-non-nuclear-sites).

### Asbestos

Asbestos is a mineral fiber that occurs in rock and soil. It's
carcinogenic and in many countries classified as a hazardous waste
subject to specific regulations. Because of its fiber strength and heat
resistance, asbestos has been used in a variety of building construction
materials for insulation and as a fire retardant. It has also been used
in a wide range of manufactured goods, mostly in building materials
(roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, paper products, and asbestos
cement products), friction products (automobile clutch, brake, and
transmission parts), heat-resistant fabrics, packaging, gaskets, and
coatings.

Fibers may be released into the air by the disturbance of
asbestos-containing material during product use, demolition work,
building or home maintenance, repair, and remodeling. In general,
exposure may occur only when the asbestos-containing material is
disturbed or damaged in some way to release particles and fibers into
the air.

Asbestos is very difficult to dispose of and requires training, special
removal methods, and PPE. If you suspect that your lab has asbestos that
needs to be removed, you should not attempt to remove and dispose of it
yourself. Most cities have asbestos abatement programs that will test
and remove it for a fee. Contact your appropriate city or jurisdiction
for more guidance on waste treatment options.

13. Biological Safety
=====================

Introduction
------------

Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, typically refer to
biologically derived materials that pose a threat to the health of
humans, animals, or the environment.

Categories of biohazards include:

-   Human, animal, and plant pathogens: bacteria, fungi, viruses, and
    > parasites toxins

-   Human and animal blood, blood products, tissues, and body fluids

-   Cultured cells and potentially infectious agents within them

-   Allergens

-   Recombinant DNA products

-   Clinical, necropsy, and surgical specimens (e.g., tissues, fluids)

Such hazards have various routes of entry to the body, such as through
the eyes, mouth, lungs, and open wounds.This can come about in a variety
of ways including:

-   Aerosol generation (e.g., pipetting, vortexing, centrifuging, etc.)

-   Manipulation with sharps

-   Spills and splashes into the mucous membranes

-   Contact with blood or bodily fluids

-   Handling animals (e.g., bites and scratches)

Some biohazards can reproduce and spread infection throughout the body
and be transmitted to other people, in addition to causing allergic
reactions or irritations. This makes their risk profile significantly
different to chemical hazards.

Risk Groups 
-----------

Risk Groups are a classification system for the hazard associated with
an organism. The risk group will help determine what level of biological
containment you will need in order to work safely with that organism.
Depending on where your lab is located, these can either be called
biosafety levels (BSLs) or containment levels (CLs). They typically have
a number associated with them (i.e., BSL 1-4) with higher numbers
indicating that more containment measures are required.

### Risk Group Definitions

Risk Group definitions are largely similar but vary slightly by country
or organization. See [[this
table]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vdTFevvdlZqvkiiS95Uyg_NQXqf6fkSJ3QGejhRDaE/edit?usp=sharing)
for a list of the various definitions.

**Risk Group 1:** A microorganism, nucleic acid, or protein that is
either (a) incapable of causing human or animal disease; or (b) capable
of causing human or animal disease, but unlikely to do so. Risk Group 1
pathogens are capable of causing disease are considered pathogens that
pose a low risk to the health of individuals or animals and a low risk
to public health or animal population. They can be opportunistic and may
pose a threat to immunocompromised individuals. (e.g., lab strains of
*E.coli*, bakers yeast).

**Risk Group 2:** A pathogen or toxin that poses a moderate risk to the
health of individuals or animals and a low risk to public health and the
animal population. These pathogens are able to cause serious disease in
a human or animal but are unlikely to do so. Effective treatment and
preventive measures are available and the risk of spread of diseases
caused by these pathogens is low. (e.g., bacteria like Campylobacter
\[causes food poisoning\] or parasites like *Toxoplasma gondii* \[causes
toxoplasmosis\]).

**Risk Group 3**: A pathogen that poses a high risk to the health of
individuals or animals and a low risk to public health. These pathogens
are likely to cause serious disease in a human or animal. Effective
treatment and preventive measures are usually available and the risk of
spread of disease caused by these pathogens is low for the public. The
risk of spread to the animal population, however, can range from low to
high depending on the pathogen (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, *Bacillus
anthracis* \[produces anthrax spores\]).

**Risk Group 4:** A pathogen that poses a high risk to the health of
individuals or animals and a high risk to public health. These pathogens
are likely to cause serious disease in a human or animal, which can
often lead to death. Effective treatment and preventive measures are not
usually available and the risk of spread of disease caused by these
pathogens is high for the public. The risk of spread of disease to the
animal population, however, ranges from low to high, depending on the
pathogen (e.g., Ebola virus, smallpox).

### How to Determine the Risk Group for an Organism that Someone Wants to Bring into the Lab?

We strongly recommend that you do not allow any organism into your lab
without knowing the official strain name or acquiring a high-quality,
sequence-based identification (e.g., full-length 16S sequence for
bacteria). Any educational suppliers should be able to tell you exactly
which strains they are selling, even if this information might not be
directly visible on their website.

Once you know the exact strain, how do you know if this strain is
actually safe to use in your lab? Official national or international
Risk Group Databases can be a good starting point. Here is an incomplete
list of useful resources:

-   Canada's Risk Group Database:

> [[https://health.canada.ca/en/epathogen]{.ul}](https://health.canada.ca/en/epathogen)

-   ABSA's Risk Group Database:

> [[https://my.absa.org/Riskgroups]{.ul}](https://my.absa.org/Riskgroups)

-   Swiss Classifications of Organisms:

> [[https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/biotechnology/publications-studies/publications/classification-of-organisms.html]{.ul}](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/biotechnology/publications-studies/publications/classification-of-organisms.html)

-   Germany's Database of safety-assessed microorganisms:

> [[https://zag.bvl.bund.de/organismen/index.jsf]{.ul}](https://zag.bvl.bund.de/organismen/index.jsf)

### Culture Collections

Official Risk Group Databases don't always cover the organisms you might
be interested in or are not specific enough in distinguishing between
different strains of a species. In many cases, it can be useful to look
up an organism at one of the large Culture Collections as well. These
are some of the largest culture collections in the world and contain
recommended risk groups for tens of thousands of organisms:

-   American Type Culture Collection (ATCC):

> [[https://www.atcc.org/]{.ul}](https://www.atcc.org/)

-   DSMZ (Germany):

> [[https://www.dsmz.de/home.html]{.ul}](https://www.dsmz.de/home.html)

Note that the official names for many organisms are under revision as
scientists are sequencing more genomes and updating the taxonomies
accordingly. In some cases, you may need to look up an organism under a
different genus or species name to find the required information. You
can look up the history of all names changes in the NCBI taxonomy
database:

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)

Biosafety Levels/Containment Levels 
-----------------------------------

### What Is a Biosafety or Containment Level?

Some biological organisms can cause harm to health or the environment.
Biosafety or containment levels are sets of measures to prevent these
organisms from being released and/or infecting people, animals, and
plants. There are [[four levels]{.ul}](#risk-groups) of human
disease-causing organisms (pathogens) that typically correspond to four
levels of containment: BSL-1, -2, -3, and -4.

Very few community labs have the infrastructure for BSL-2 or could
maintain the infrastructure and requirements necessary to comply with
recommendations for a BSL-2 environment. We recommend that you
thoroughly understand the legal and management infrastructure of running
a BSL-2 lab before working with pathogens. We strongly recommend against
working beyond BSL-2 in a community labs context.

Do All Experiments Need to Take Place in a Containment Lab?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No! Some organisms do not pose a risk to health or the environment.
There are [[plenty of
experiments]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkbBgtMBxffIJk4WRtE6Tuuy8TQbjywX9WDJXULx7_g/edit)
that are safe for kitchens, makerspaces, and more.

Some countries have stricter regulations than others. For example, in
Europe any genetic modification experiment or genetically modified
organisms must be in a containment laboratory, regardless of their level
of risk to health and the environment.

Biosafety Level 1 
-----------------

BSL-1 is a set of containment measures that maintain a safe workspace
for using well-characterized biological organisms that are:

-   Not known to cause disease in adult humans with a healthy immune
    > system

-   Present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel

-   Present minimal potential hazard to the environment

Requirements differ by country, but the main things to consider are
listed below. This list also assumes that standard microbiological
safety practices are followed.

### Lab Facilities

1.  The lab should have doors for access control.

2.  The lab must have a sink for hand washing.

3.  The lab should be designed so that it can be easily cleaned. Carpets
    > and rugs in labs are not appropriate.

4.  Lab furniture must be capable of supporting anticipated loads and
    > uses. Spaces between benches, cabinets, and equipment should be
    > accessible for cleaning.

    a.  Bench tops must be impervious to water and resistant to heat,
        > organic solvents, acids, alkalis, and other chemicals.

    b.  Chairs used in laboratory work must be covered with a non-porous
        > material that can be easily cleaned and decontaminated with an
        > appropriate disinfectant.

5.  Laboratories windows that open to the exterior should be fitted with
    > screens.

### Safety and Personal Protective Equipment

1.  Special containment devices or equipment, such as biological safety
    > cabinets, are not generally required.

2.  [Wear p]{.ul}[[rotective laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms to
    > prevent contamination of personal
    > clothing.]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KhUmKDNtTEsN4u4oiUHs4RNZiWPN8_6X1w0IynYP70A/edit)

3.  Wear [[protective
    > eyewear]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KhUmKDNtTEsN4u4oiUHs4RNZiWPN8_6X1w0IynYP70A/edit#heading=h.4gwquaxi6d73)
    > when conducting procedures that can splash microorganisms or
    > hazardous materials.

4.  [[Gloves]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KhUmKDNtTEsN4u4oiUHs4RNZiWPN8_6X1w0IynYP70A/edit#heading=h.4yglaxko56ic)
    > must be worn to protect hands from exposure to hazardous
    > materials. BSL-1 organisms themselves may not be considered
    > hazardous materials, but gloves should be worn anyway as a
    > protective measure. Glove selection should be based on an
    > appropriate risk assessment. In addition, BSL-1 workers should:

    a.  Change gloves when contaminated, glove integrity is compromised,
        > or when otherwise necessary.

    b.  Remove gloves and wash hands when work with hazardous materials
        > has been completed and before leaving the laboratory.

    c.  Do not wash or reuse disposable gloves. Dispose of used gloves
        > with contaminated laboratory waste.

5.  Wash hands prior to leaving the laboratory.

### Training and Supervision

1.  Lab members must have training in the procedures conducted in the
    > lab. Ideally, they'd be supervised by a scientist with training in
    > microbiology or a related science.

2.  The laboratory supervisor must ensure that laboratory members
    > receive appropriate training regarding:

    a.  their duties

    b.  the necessary precautions to prevent exposures

    c.  exposure evaluation procedures.

3.  Members must receive annual updates or additional training when
    > procedural or policy changes occur.

4.  Personal health status may impact an individual's susceptibility to
    > infection, ability to receive immunizations, or prophylactic
    > interventions. Therefore, all lab members, particularly women of
    > childbearing age, should be provided with information regarding
    > immune competence and conditions that may predispose them to
    > infection. Immunocompromised individuals should contact their
    > healthcare provider for guidance.

Biosafety Level 2
-----------------

Few community biology labs are pursuing experiments requiring BSL-2
space, but a few do exist. Work at BSL-2 involves organisms that pose
moderate hazards to lab personnel, the wider community, and the
environment. Containment measures are more stringent than BSL-1 to
maintain a sterile work space, prevent contamination, avoid lab-acquired
infections, and potential environmental releases.

Beyond measures recommended for a BSL-1 facility, additional measures
should be taken in a BSL-2 lab:

-   Clear identification must be made for spaces dedicated to BSL-2.

-   Access to the BSL-2 area must be restricted when work is being
    > conducted.

-   Lab members must be trained in handling pathogenic agents. Ideally,
    > they should be supervised by scientists competent in handling
    > infectious agents.

-   All procedures in which infectious aerosols or splashes may be
    > created are conducted in a biosafety cabinet or other physical
    > containment equipment.

-   If warranted by risk assessment, members should be encouraged to go
    > get checked out by their personal physician, inform their
    > physician what they are working with, and get regular medical
    > checkups thereafter.

-   There may be more regional regulations beyond those listed above.

### Laboratory Facilities

1.  Lab doors should be self-closing and have locks.

2.  Windows that open to the exterior are not recommended. However, if a
    > laboratory does have windows that open to the exterior, they must
    > be fitted with screens.

3.  Biological safety cabinets (BSCs) must be installed so that
    > fluctuations of the room air supply and exhaust do not interfere
    > with proper operations. BSCs should be located away from doors,
    > windows that can be opened, heavily traveled laboratory areas, and
    > other possible airflow disruptions.

4.  Vacuum lines should be protected with liquid disinfectant traps.

5.  An eyewash station must be readily available.

6.  There are no specific requirements for ventilation systems. However,
    > planning of new facilities should consider mechanical ventilation
    > systems that provide an inward flow of air without recirculation
    > to spaces outside of the laboratory.

7.  HEPA filtered exhaust air from a Class II BSC can be safely
    > recirculated back into the laboratory environment if the cabinet
    > is tested and certified at least annually and operated according
    > to manufacturer's recommendations. BSCs can also be connected to
    > the laboratory exhaust system by either a thimble (canopy)
    > connection or directly exhausted to the outside through a hard
    > connection. Provisions to assure proper safety cabinet performance
    > and air system operation must be verified.

8.  A method for decontaminating all [[laboratory
    > wastes]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/edit#heading=h.ozdhjpv6ch5q)
    > should be available in the facility (e.g., autoclave, chemical
    > disinfection, incineration, or other validated decontamination
    > method).

### Safety and Personal Protective Equipment

1.  Properly maintained BSCs, other appropriate personal protective
    > equipment, or other physical containment devices must be used
    > whenever:

    a.  Procedures with a potential for creating infectious aerosols or
        > splashes are conducted. These may include pipetting,
        > centrifuging, grinding, blending, shaking, mixing, sonicating,
        > opening containers of infectious materials, inoculating
        > animals intranasally, and harvesting infected tissues from
        > animals or eggs

    b.  b\. High concentrations or large volumes of infectious agents
        > are used. Such materials may be centrifuged in the open
        > laboratory using sealed rotor heads or centrifuge safety cups.

2.  Protective laboratory coats, gowns, smocks, or uniforms designated
    > for laboratory use must be worn while working with hazardous
    > materials. Remove protective clothing before leaving for
    > non-laboratory areas, e.g., cafeteria, library, and administrative
    > offices. Dispose of protective clothing appropriately, or deposit
    > it for laundering by the institution. It is recommended that
    > laboratory clothing not be taken home.

3.  Eye and face protection (goggles, mask, face shield, or other
    > splatter guard) is used for anticipated splashes or sprays of
    > infectious or other hazardous materials when the microorganisms
    > must be handled outside the BSC or containment device. Eye and
    > face protection must be disposed of with other contaminated
    > laboratory waste or decontaminated before reuse.

4.  Eye, face, and respiratory protection should be used in rooms
    > containing infected animals as determined by the risk assessment.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

\*Safety is improved when PPE is used in combination with physical
containment devices or equipment, such as Biological Safety Cabinets
(BSCs).

Biohazard Symbol and Use Thereof
--------------------------------

The CDC's
[[BMBL]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/labs/pdf/CDC-BiosafetyMicrobiologicalBiomedicalLaboratories-2009-P.PDF)
recommends that the universal biohazard symbol be posted at the entrance
labs containing infectious agents. This is recommended for BSL-2 level
work, but is not absolutely required for a BSL-1 lab. The lab's
biosafety level must be posted.

**Universal Biohazard Symbol**

Biosafety for Human-derived Materials 
-------------------------------------

Human-derived materials are critical to diagnostics and for real
representation of disease. A risk assessment and often an ethical review
is necessary for the types and conditions for use of these materials.
These materials are often rated at a minimum of BSL-2. They are often
sought for a unique disease state or background. However, they could
contain unknown endogenous or co-infections and can harbor infectious
agents. For example, while urine may be considered BSL-1 in a healthy
adult, it has been known to pass diseases such as Croydon Typhoid or
Tuberculosis. Blood and blood products are another case that is often
considered BSL-1 from a blood bank because of the rigorous testing done
on the sample. However, some viruses do not have definitive tests. It is
also important to consider the source and testing done at the stock
center for common diseases during the risk assessment. In this context,
a self-derived sample may not be acceptable practice.

Samples have been taken from the following sources:

-   Saliva or buccal samples

-   Urine or feces

-   Blood or blood products such as red or white blood cells plasma

-   Human cell lines

-   Organs

-   Tissues

-   Cerebrospinal fluid

-   Tears

-   Eyeball fluid

Human and Animal Cell Lines
---------------------------

Cell lines are living cells that were isolated from animals or humans
and grown in culture. Cells cultured directly from an organism, called
*primary cells*, typically have a very limited life span. However, most
cell lines have been *immortalized*; they have been mutated through
chemical means, through the use of a mutagenic virus, or during the
course of a naturally occuring cancer (as is the case with the infamous
HeLa cells) to escape the lifespan limitations that most healthy cells
have.

Cell lines may carry diseases that were present in the original donor
organism. In addition, cell lines lack an immune system and can be
infected with whatever the researcher carries and can then spread those
infections to others in the lab. The greater the species barrier, the
less chance of infections being transmitted between the cell lines and
the researchers and vice versa. So working with mollusc, insect, fish,
reptile, or amphibian cell lines can be relatively safe. These can still
host zoonotic viral diseases like bird flu, or the rich media can become
contaminated with bacteria like Salmonella. Working with mammalian
(mouse, rat, pig), primate (monkey, ape), or human cell lines carries
progressively more risk. Likewise, certain tissue or cell types carry
greater risk than others. In descending order of risk (from ABSA
"Principles & Practices of Biosafety" course):

-   Hematopoietic cells and tissues (stem cells that give rise to blood
    > cells, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue)

-   Neural tissue (brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid \[CSF\])

-   Endothelium and gut mucosa (organ lining, inner lining of
    > intestines)

-   Epithelial cells and fibroblasts (skin, outer layer of organs)

Nevertheless, there are a number of human cell lines that have been
carefully screened for existing diseases or the presence of any
mutagenic viruses that were used to immortalize the cells and that can
be safe for use in a BSL-1 lab.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Important note when ordering [[human cell lines from ATCC]{.ul}](https://www.atcc.org/search?title=ATCC%20Human%20Cell%20Lines%20-%20Alphanumeric#q=%40productline%3DC021&f:contentTypeFacetATCC=%5BProducts%5D&f:biosafetyLevelFacet=%5B1%5D) (and possibly other stock centers?): The biosafety levels assigned by ATCC for cell lines refer to shipping only**!** Cell lines labeled BSL-1 have been screened for the presence of HIV, HepB, HPV, EBV, and CMV. However since cell lines cannot be tested for all viruses, ATCC recommends handling all cultures under BSL-2 conditions as a safety precaution. Each researcher should determine the appropriate BSL using a risk assessment based on the characteristics of the cell line and how the cell line will be used (see [[How does ATCC assign biosafety levels for cell lines?]{.ul}](http://atcc.org/Global/FAQs/2/6/Biosafety%20level%20for%20ATCC%20cultures-9.aspx)).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with human cell lines is technically demanding because they are
fragile and prone to contamination. Work often requires greater
expertise and higher standards of lab cleanliness and sterility than
when working with bacteria. For that reason, community labs that do
allow work with BSL-1 human cell lines in the general lab often confine
such work to a separate section of the lab dedicated to that purpose.

Human Samples
-------------

### Using Your Own or "Autologous" Samples 

Autologous samples are samples that are derived from oneself. Examples
are swabs taken from cheek cells (buccal swab), nasal swabs, skin, or
bodily fluids.These are of course free and readily available with
permission. We recommend the following policies when letting members in
your lab work with autologous samples:

-   Samples should not be cultured. Culturing allows potential pathogens
    > to expand their populations making it possible to create an
    > infectious culture. (BSL-2 containment level is required for
    > culturing of autologous samples, including microbiomes.)

-   Immediately lyse the sample. Cell lysis kills most cellular
    > pathogens, while leaving useful molecules like DNA intact.

-   Don't trade samples or work with samples that are not your own. This
    > prevents the possibility of infecting someone else with pathogens
    > you may already have.

-   Be especially rigorous about storage, cleanup, and waste disposal
    > procedures. Even though autologous samples are generally safe for
    > the experimenter, they carry significant risks of infecting others
    > in the lab.

Microbiome
----------

Microbiomes are an exciting and rapidly advancing field. The human
microbiome has a wide variety of microbes, many of which can be
pathogenic. Care should be taken when collecting and processing
microbiome samples. Consider the possibility of culturing pathogens in
your risk assessment. Projects including the gut microbiome or fecal
material are considered BSL-2 and care should be taken before being
approved in the lab.

Environmental Samples
---------------------

In a BSL-1 lab, you are expected to know the exact organisms with which
you are working. Because it's impossible to know which organisms you're
collecting when taking environmental and microbiome samples, culturing
these samples is generally not permitted under BSL-1 conditions. This is
because you may unexpectedly exponentially amplify pathogenic strains
that were in trace amounts in the source material. For more information
and some potential exceptions, see [[Chapter 14 - Working with
Microbes]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit).

Many labs allow work with environmental samples as long as they are
immediately inactivated by autoclaving, chemical, or enzymatic methods,
or they are filter sterilized, e.g., to extract DNA for sequencing or
for chemical analysis. Even under those conditions, labs should restrict
samples that are known or are suspected to carry disease, such as
sewage, animal or human remains, stool/blood samples, etc. Likewise,
great care should be taken with samples that may contain heavy metal,
chemical contamination or even radioactivity (e.g., collecting soil or
sediment samples from polluted sites!).

Prior to collecting samples, you should investigate what occurred
previously on those locations to determine potential risks with samples
taken. As always, the safety committee should decide where to draw the
line in dealing with potentially hazardous samples and what additional
safeguards may be needed.

Food Projects
-------------

Standard microbiological practices forbid any food or drink in the
laboratory. But what if you are doing research on food or developing a
novel food in the lab? Examples of this include [[Real Vegan
Cheese]{.ul}](https://realvegancheese.org),
[[Shojinmeat]{.ul}](https://shojinmeat.com/wordpress/en/), cellular
agriculture projects, isolating foodsafe cultures, or producing plant
extracts using lab equipment. These can be great and innovative projects
but require precautions in order to keep your lab and its members safe.

We recommend the following precautions:

**Designate a separate lab area, equipment, and plasticware for food
projects.** Whenever possible you should maintain a strict separation
between the laboratory and the outside world. For example, when Counter
Culture Labs ordered a number of cheese ripening bacterial strains they
purchased two packets of each---one for use inside the lab for culturing
and experiments and the other for cheese making and taste testing
outside the lab. While it is acceptable to bring a food sample into the
lab for study, it should never be brought out again for consumption.

**Bringing things out of the laboratory**. If you are considering
removing or consuming something that has been cultured or processed in
the lab, we recommend the utmost care and forethought. We recommend that
you perform a separate risk assessment (see [[How to do a risk
assessment]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8))
and document guidelines for how to do this safely in your specific
context.

These guidelines should establish the required level of evidence that
the material requires to be taken out of the lab and practices for
avoiding cross contamination. They should take into consideration
whether to use a third party service to test for safety and
contamination and procedures for documenting containers to use at each
step of the process and how those containers should be cleaned.

Additional guidelines might include establishing a quarantine area where
cultures can be passaged to determine if they are clean, DNA sequencing
to determine purity, testing for protein purity, endo-toxin assays,
exposure testing with human cell lines, etc.

**Dealing with regulatory agencies**. Formal approval of a novel food by
regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
required before commercializing a product. Typically, commercial
products require further testing in a
"[[GMP]{.ul}](https://ispe.org/initiatives/regulatory-resources/gmp/what-is-gmp)"
lab specified by the FDA. The regulatory process can be lengthy and
expensive and typically attempted once you have enough startup funding
to pay for lawyers and consultants to guide you through the process.

It may be useful to contact the
[[FDA]{.ul}](https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements)
or other regulators early in order to get their input on which aspects
of the project to preempt problems down the road. For example, the Real
Vegan Cheese project contacted the FDA for feedback on recombinant
cheese proteins, which led the team to refocus their goal on creating
recombinant cow cheese proteins rather than human proteins, which the
FDA scrutinizes more deeply.

Drug Development Projects
-------------------------

Some projects in community labs are developing drugs that are intended
for therapeutic use in humans (e.g., the [[Open Insulin
Project]{.ul}](https://openinsulin.org)). These projects bring into
focus many of the issues discussed above for food projects but with
additional considerations and risks.

**Self-experimentation**

There are few (if any) regulations in most countries preventing
self-experimentation with legal substances and treatments, and there is
also a long history of
[[self-experimentation]{.ul}](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/rej.2018.2059)
in science (see also
[[Wikipedia]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation_in_medicine)).
For example, in 2005 Barry Marsell famously infected himself with
*Heliobacter pylori* to prove that it caused stomach ulcers, and he was
eventually awarded the Nobel Prize. Other self-experiments haven't gone
nearly as well. For example, in 1954, John Stapp, airforce officer and
physician, was testing the effects of rapid acceleration and
deceleration and caused several broken bones, concussions, and permanent
vision loss during self-testing. Famously, in 1928 Alexander Bogdanov
died when he gave himself a transfusion with an incompatible blood type.

Whether you allow self-experimentation in your lab requires a lengthy
risk assessment. Some have extolled self-experimentation as an
expression of [[personal body
autonomy]{.ul}](http://biosummit.org/ethics) and even as a fundamental
right protected by the [[UN Declaration of Human
Rights]{.ul}](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html).
Others see it as a risk not worth taking, especially among biology
novices. As an organization, you will need to account for the ethical
considerations, safety risks, legal liabilities, risks to the lab and
lab members, damage of reputation, and more, when making this decision.
You should also consider whether your experiments may give false hope to
patients or may inspire copycat experimenters to take far greater risks.
Please note that many community labs forbid it.

**Methods You Should Consider *Before* or *Instead of* Any
Self-experimentation**

-   Bacterial, yeast, single-cell eukaryotic testing

-   Computer modeling simulations of protein pathway networks

-   Testing with cell-free systems (e.g., protein-protein interactions,
    > detection systems)

-   Trying things out on human cell lines and animals (e.g., on mice
    > through a contract research organization).

**Requests from Patients or Patient Advocates**

Often community lab projects, labs, and lab members are contacted by
desperate patients or patient advocates asking for help with a disease.
These come in many different forms of solicitation; from general science
questions to more aggressive requests for clinical testing, studies, or
drug discovery---often in response to a scientific article or crackpot
theory that has been in the news.

These solicitation situations can be difficult on many different levels.
Please have the patience and empathy to navigate the emotionally
difficult experience while avoiding giving medical advice. Take great
care when approaching these projects because of the emotional
difficulty, scientific complexity, and possible exposure to public
relations and legal risk.

In the majority of cases, these individuals have run out of alternatives
from the scientific and medical community and are desperate for help.
The community lab may choose to decline with utmost compassion, redirect
to professional resources, or ignore the request (examples below). If
the community lab or members decide to aid these individuals, they
should consider the [[NIH guidelines on human
research]{.ul}](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects.htm) and
[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA)]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html)
privacy regulations.

**Sample Message: Decline with Compassion**

Dear (Patient advocate),

We are saddened to hear about your (patient). We understand your
frustration and desire to help your (patient) affected by this
affliction. Many of us are just like you and have had people close to us
affected by diseases with no cure. Our institution is not in a position
to aid because we lack the resources (money and infrastructure), skills,
and knowledge to tackle this problem. We support and encourage you to
get involved and become the champion for change. We appreciate your
passion to find the solutions to these complex problems. Science is
difficult, and it is going to take a lot of ideas and tests to discover
the solution.

**Sample Message: Redirect to Professional Resources**

Dear (Patient advocate),

We are saddened to hear about your (patient). Our institution is not in
a position to help. We lack the resources necessary to tackle a problem
of this magnitude. We have, however, gathered some resources that might
be helpful, and we encourage you to contact them for more information.

Genetically Engineered Organisms and Recombinant DNA/Synthetic Nucleic Acids
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genetically engineered organisms come with their own sets of concerns.
These can change the function of an organism to become pathogenic or a
health or environmental hazard. Before modifying an organism, perform a
risk assessment. Here are some common terms when referring to
genetically engineered organisms:

**Genetically modified organism (GMO)**; Any organism whose genetic
material has been altered using genetic engineering technologies.

**Recombinant DNA technology**: A set of tools that combine genetic
material from different sources to create GMOs that may have never
existed in nature before.

**Recombinant nucleic acids:** Molecules that have been constructed by
joining nucleic acids (DNA) usually by combining DNA from different
organisms that can replicate in a living cell.

**Synthetic nucleic acids**: ucleic acid molecules that are chemically
(or by other means) synthesized or amplified, including those that are
chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally
occurring nucleic acid molecules.

### General Concerns

Because GMOs are often novel creations, they can have unforeseen
interactions with their environments and other organisms. The following
may be concerns regarding their development and propagation:

**General Scientific Considerations**

-   **Function of the genetic insert:** The function of genes inserted
    > into an organism may affect the associated risks. For example, if
    > you were to put a gene-related pathogenicity or toxicity into a
    > nonpathogenic organism, you might consider it a BSL-2 organism and
    > require more stringent containment procedures.

-   **Source:** Is the organism that the insert is coming from a
    > pathogen or a known toxic agent? If so, you might be making your
    > host organism more dangerous.

-   **Transfer methods:** Is the recombination method used for
    > modification harmful (chemical/physical methods of gene transfer
    > vs. viral vectors)? Some reagents and techniques used to engineer
    > organisms can be harmful to humans and the environment.

-   **Property of the modified organism:** What new traits will the
    > resulting organism have? Can the organism harm people or the
    > environment?

**Human Health**

-   **Pathogenicity:** Has the new recombinant organism become
    > pathogenic or have the potential to become pathogenic. For
    > example, is it expressing any virulence factors? If so, does the
    > organism require new containment or deactivation methods?

-   **Health effects of new traits:** Are there other health effects
    > that the GMO now can cause (e.g., is it now an allergen, or can
    > produce allergens, or has it become a probiotic organism that
    > could colonize humans or animals). How should it be treated
    > differently from the original organism?

**Environmental/Agricultural**

-   **Survival, multiplication, dissemination:** How does the modified
    > organism behave in the environment (e.g., can it survive, will it
    > outcompete other organisms, etc.). What containment methods should
    > be considered? Should the experiment be done at all?

-   **Interactions of GMOs with biological systems:** Will the modified
    > organism disrupt ecological systems by changing what and how other
    > organisms survive/exist? What should be done to minimize this
    > risk?

### Evaluation Criteria

In order to assess whether any of the above concerns are warranted,
you'll need to evaluate proposed GMO experiments in your community
biology lab. The following list describes the criteria to evaluate to
determine the biosafety/containment level that is required for the safe
handling of the resulting GMO:

-   **The properties of the recipient/host organism:** Knowledge of the
    > unmodified host is usually the starting point for risk
    > assessmentIs (is the host organism itself a known pathogen, or an
    > opportunistic pathogen).

-   **The properties of the donor organism:** What organism does theDNA
    > sequence come from? If you don't know anything about the organism,
    > research using
    > [[Pubmed]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) or another
    > literature database before approving a project.

-   T**he nature of the DNA sequences:** What potential hazards might
    > arise directly from the product of the inserted gene. Ask members
    > to provide the DNA sequence they plan to use and conduct your own
    > [[Blast]{.ul}](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search to
    > understand the properties. Could they have known biologically or
    > pharmacologically active properties that may give rise to harm,
    > for example, do they encode:

    -   **Toxins:** You can blast your sequence in [[UniProt
        > t]{.ul}](http://www.uniprot.org/blast/)o see if it matches any
        > known toxins.

    -   **Cytokines:** Immune proteins that can have effects directly on
        > immune systems.

    -   **Hormones:** Molecules that can affect many physiological
        > processes.

    -   **Gene expression regulators:** Proteins that can affect cell
        > behavior by interfering with DNA.

    -   **Virulence factors or enhancers:** Proteins that make pathogens
        > more likely to spread.

    -   **Oncogenic gene sequences:** Genes that can cause cancer.

    -   **Antibiotic resistance:** Genes that make organisms resistant
        > to antibiotics.

    -   **Allergens**: Proteins that can cause an allergic reaction.
        > Match your sequence to known allergens on the [[allergen
        > database]{.ul}](http://www.allergenonline.org/).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Case study:** Heme proteins are an essential component of red blood cells. One project that came to BioCurious was a proposal to modify *E. coli* to synthesize hemoglobin and iron binders to help the bacteria produce heme at industrial levels. Genetically engineering bacteria to make iron-fixing proteins increases the ability of *E. coli* to bind and uptake iron, and thus would move the organism into the next risk group. The human gut tightly binds and sequesters iron to inhibit the growth of pathogens. Enabling bacteria to compete with humans for iron would make this or other bacteria potentially pathogenic. Therefore modifications to the project needed to be made to support the project while keeping the risk level low.

### The NIH Guidelines and Low Risk Recombinant DNA and Synthetic Nucleic Acid Experiments

The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a set of [[Guidelines
for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid
Molecules]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.pdf)
(NIH Guidelines), which outlines Risk Assessment and Risk Group
assignment for genetic engineering experiments, reporting or
pre-approval requirements for certain classes of experiments, and
biosafety and containment recommendations. These NIH Guidelines carry
the same weight of authority in the U. S. as the [[BMBL
guidelines]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html), that is, they are
primarily enforced by federal funding agencies. While not mandatory for
a community lab to follow, they are recommended and can be helpful for
assessing the risk of recombinant DNA and synthetic nucleic acid
projects. Note that labs receiving federal funding are required to abide
by the NIH guidelines.

Within the NIH guidelines is a broad list of "exemptions" that do not
require pre-approval. These can be considered lower risk experiments
though still require a risk assessment and should be performed at the
appropriate biosafety level. Many genetic engineering experiments done
at community labs will tend to fall under these exemptions. In
particular, *most* experiments with engineered plasmids in *E. coli,*
*Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces*, *and B. subtilis* will be exempt from
the NIH guidelines. Many community labs teach genetic engineering and
introduce synthetic biology to the public using these expression
systems. Thus, routine genetic engineering experiments can safely be
performed in a BSL-1 lab.

These are some of the categories of experiments for which the NIH
guidelines recommend higher levels of review or preapproval:

-   Release into the environment

-   Inserting toxin genes, genes from a higher risk group donor
    > organism, or novel drug-resistance genes in a microorganism

-   Human gene transfer

-   Work with eukaryotic viruses

or
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.atlanta.va.gov/Docs/Simplified_NIH_rDNA_Classification_Guidelines.pdf).

It is very important at the conclusion of these experiments to
[[properly
dispose]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/edit#heading=h.ozdhjpv6ch5q)
of the bacteria and prevent the release of the recombinant and/or
antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment.

Gene Editing Technology
-----------------------

The biosafety requirements related to new methods of modifying the
genome are still not entirely clear. While some of these techniques,
such CRISPR, are promising based on the fact that the modifications made
within the genome are much more specific than recombinant DNA methods,
there is evidence that there can be off-target effects (meaning that an
unintended portion of the DNA is modified), and research to detect and
understand the effects of these off-target is still in progress. No
particular guidelines for working with these methods have been published
by the NIH or other regulatory agencies.

Example of gene editing methods include:

-   Genome editing with site-directed nucleases (SDNs), e.g., using
    > clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
    > (CRISPR)--directed nucleases, transcription activator-like
    > effector nuclease (TALENs), zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), or
    > meganucleases. SDN-based techniques can also be applied for
    > multiplex genome editing and "base editing" as well as for
    > modification of transcriptional regulation.

-   Genome editing directed by synthetic oligonucleotides, also referred
    > to as oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (ODM).

-   RNA directed DNA methylation, an approach for modifying epigenetic
    > regulation of gene expression.

### Regulation of Gene Editing

In 2018, the U.S. made the decision to not regulate plants created
through gene editing. The [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture
stated]{.ul}](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2018/03/28/secretary-perdue-issues-usda-statement-plant-breeding-innovation)
that gene editing "can introduce new plant traits more quickly and
precisely, potentially saving years or even decades in bringing needed
new varieties to farmers." The [[EU, on the other hand,
decided]{.ul}](https://www.iucn.org/news/world-commission-environmental-law/201808/european-court-justice-ruling-genome-editing)
that "\...modern techniques and methods of directed alteration of
genetic material (genome editing) constitute a genetic modification and
do not fall under the mutagenesis exemption." Thus, in the EU trial
releases of plants and animals obtained by genome editing will be
[[regulated]{.ul}](https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/content/documents/2018/judgment_of_the_court_-_c-528-16.pdf)
as other GMOs.

Pathogens
---------

Some bacteria, fungi, viruses, and some eukaryotes can be pathogenic to
humans. In the right environment, organisms that normally do not cause
disease can become infectious. Normally, the immune system will resist
these organisms. However, in immunocompromised individuals these
normally benign organisms can become problematic including from
experiments that are done under the lowest biosafety levels (e.g.,
BSL-1).

The use of any human pathogen by definition is outside the scope of a
BSL-1 laboratory and must be conducted at BSL-2 level or higher. In many
cases, there are closely related strains or species that are safer to
work with (as is the case with lab strains of *E. coli* compared to the
pathogenic *E. coli* strain O157 associated with foodborne outbreaks).

For those interested in developing detection methods for pathogens, some
reputable vendors provide inactivated cells/viruses or purified genomic
DNA that are considered safe for use in a BSL-1 environment. As always,
even though this may strictly fall within BSL-1, it is up to the lab
management to decide if they want to take on the additional risk
associated with working with such materials. This includes any potential
public relations issues that may arise around "biohackers working with
dangerous pathogens."

A few community labs have started setting up BSL-2 laboratories that in
principle can handle pathogens that are capable, although unlikely, to
cause serious disease in humans or animals. Each lab should make a
conscious policy decision on whether to allow such work and be sure to
follow the CDC's BSL-2 guidelines described above.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the USDA
maintain a list of [[Biological Select Agents or
Toxins]{.ul}](https://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html),
know as "select agents" that pose a severe threat to human health or
agriculture.

Laboratories authorized to work with select agents are strictly
regulated by the U.S. CDC through the [[Federal Select Agent
Program]{.ul}](https://www.selectagents.gov). Community labs may come
across such select agents when identifying bacterial isolates from
animal or environmental samples and may be required to secure those
biological materials and
[[report]{.ul}](https://www.selectagents.gov/faq-reporting.html) such
instances.

**14. Working with Microbes**
=============================

**Introduction**
----------------

Microorganisms such as bacteria, protists, and fungi are amazing forms
of nature. Studying them continues to lead to important discoveries in
biology. They are important for the biomedical field, food producers,
artists, environmental engineers, and others.

Microorganisms are usually handled at a specific [[Biosafety
Level]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit#heading=h.o5m4y9nt1dkx)
(BSL). The BSL classifies the microorganism by their ability to infect
and cause disease. The BSL classification affects the manner and place a
particular organism may be used. Before starting work, perform a [[risk
assessment]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/edit#heading=h.c53xish5qaj7)
that takes into account the type of microorganism being considered for
use, what will be done with the organism, and the risks of the lab
procedures to be carried out.

The microorganisms used most frequently in community biology labs are
non-pathogenic strains of *E. coli*, *Bacillus subtilis*, and
*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Many community labs have a [[White
List]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6127UTtulZCvwUNRTIHpELlinCozrgSOMguKzwP3j4/edit#gid=1364505102)
of microorganisms that present minimum risk provided that good lab
practices are followed (see example
[[here]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6127UTtulZCvwUNRTIHpELlinCozrgSOMguKzwP3j4/edit#gid=1364505102)
and in Appendix A).

Some general guidelines for working with microorganisms in the lab
include:

1.  Proceed with caution. While most microorganisms encountered in the
    > lab will not be pathogenic, it is a good idea to treat them as
    > such.

2.  Sterilize equipment and materials before starting work.

3.  Disinfect workspaces before and after working with microorganisms.

4.  Wash hands before and after conducting work.

5.  Practice good hygiene in the lab. Do not wear open-toed shoes, keep
    > long hair pulled back, and remove or secure any dangling jewelry
    > or accessories worn.

6.  Do not eat or drink in the lab.

7.  Only work with microorganisms from [[known
    > sources]{.ul}](#sourcing-organisms-of-interest).

8.  Wear appropriate p[[ersonal protective equipment
    > (PPE)]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KhUmKDNtTEsN4u4oiUHs4RNZiWPN8_6X1w0IynYP70A/edit#heading=h.tynfzjepuxsa).

9.  Never pipette by mouth.

10. Minimize clutter in the work space.

11. Label everything so that it is clear what it is, who it belongs to,
    > and when the work was done. Label agar plates on the agar side.

12. Clean up spills carefully.

13. [[Autoclave]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit)
    > or [[disinfect]{.ul}](#disinfectants-and-their-proper-use) waste.

If individuals are new to working with microorganisms, we recommend that
they work alongside people with experience until both feel comfortable
with them working alone. It can take some time and training to become
proficient at working with microbes.

Preventing Contamination (Aseptic Technique) 
--------------------------------------------

Researchers use aseptic technique to prevent contamination with unwanted
bacteria, fungi, or viruses from the environment. The key elements of
aseptic technique are a sterile work area, good personal hygiene,
sterile reagents/media, and sterile handling.

It is important to use aseptic technique when working with living
organisms or any media, solutions, or containers used for living
organisms. Use aseptic techniques when working with toxic chemicals by
separating contents of one area of work from being contaminated by (or
contaminating) another area (e.g., DNA fragments from PCR contaminating
areas of the lab where PCR reactions are set up and contaminating
negative controls).

Here are things to consider to maintaining a sterile environment:

1.  **Workspace organization and general cleanliness.**

    a.  Avoid exposure to dust, mold, or bacterial spores. Benches for
        > aseptic work should be set away from air conditioning vents,
        > cooling fans, open windows, blowers from heating or
        > refrigerating systems, mushroom cultivation areas, or live
        > soil from potted plants.

    b.  Minimize clutter. Set the working area to minimize hand
        > movements.

    c.  Prepare your materials in advance, so that there is no need to
        > leave the work area to retrieve something.

    d.  Disinfect the workspace before and after working with
        > microorganisms using an appropriate disinfectant (e.g., a 1:10
        > bleach to water solution, optionally followed by 70%
        > ethanol/isopropanol) for the microorganism. See the section on
        > [[Disinfectants and Their Proper
        > Use]{.ul}](#disinfectants-and-their-proper-use) for more
        > information.

2.  **Bunsen burners or other flame sources and alternatives.**

    a.  **Bunsen burner.** A Bunsen burner is a lab instrument that can
        > be used to provide a single, continuous flame by mixing gas
        > with air in a controlled fashion. The ratio of gas to air that
        > is mixed together can be manually adjusted, allowing the user
        > to control the intensity, temperature, and size of the flame.
        > The Bunsen burner is the easiest way to create a relatively
        > sterile environment on the lab bench. A major purpose of the
        > open flame in aseptic technique is to create a cone of hot air
        > above and around the lab bench to reduce the viability of
        > organisms on suspended dust particles.The ability of the
        > Bunsen burner flame to heat things very quickly also makes it
        > an ideal choice for sterilizing inoculating loops, warming
        > glass bottle necks, or igniting alcohol on culture spreaders.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Safety Tips for Using a Bunsen Burner**                            |
|                                                                      |
| -   Place the Bunsen burner away from any overhead shelving,         |
|     > equipment, or light fixtures by at least 12 inches.            |
|                                                                      |
| -   Remove all paper, notebooks, combustible materials, and excess   |
|     > chemicals from the area.                                       |
|                                                                      |
|     -   Nitrocellulose membranes, commonly used for blotting         |
|         > techniques, are extremely flammable.                       |
|                                                                      |
|     -   Ethanol used for dipping culture spreaders is an exception   |
|         > to the rule regarding flammables, but only small volumes   |
|         > (≤20 ml) in glass beakers should be used at a time.        |
|                                                                      |
| -   Tie-back any long hair, dangling jewelry, or loose clothing.     |
|                                                                      |
| -   Inspect the hose for cracks, holes, pinch points, or any defect  |
|     > and ensure that the hose fits securely on the gas valve and    |
|     > the burner. Replace all hoses found to have a defect before    |
|     > using.                                                         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Notify others in the lab that the burner will be in use.         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Utilize a sparker or lighter with extended nozzle to ignite the  |
|     > burner. Never use a match to ignite a burner.                  |
|                                                                      |
| -   Have the sparker or lighter available before turning on the gas. |
|                                                                      |
| -   Adjust the flame by turning the collar to regulate air flow and  |
|     > produce an appropriate flame for the experiment (typically a   |
|     > medium blue flame).                                            |
|                                                                      |
| -   Do not leave open flames unattended                              |
|                                                                      |
| -   Never leave the lab while the burner is on.                      |
|                                                                      |
| -   Shut off gas when its use is complete.                           |
|                                                                      |
| -   Allow the burner to cool before handling.                        |
|                                                                      |
| -   Ensure that the main gas valve is off before leaving the lab.    |
|                                                                      |
| -   Never use a Bunsen burner in a biological safety cabinet or      |
|     > laminar flow hood. The heated air may disrupt air flow, damage |
|     > the hood, or cause a fire.                                     |

3.  **[[Biological safety cabinets and laminar flow
    > hoods]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit).**

Ensure that members relying on the biological safety cabinet for aseptic
conditions are trained in its use and understand how the airflow works.
A [[smoke machine]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqaWM5Dd15c) or
smoke pen can be a very effective, hands-on way of demonstrating airflow
and the different ways in which it might be disrupted. [[Click
here]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NTRWQR5sg8) for a training
video on how to properly use a biosafety cabinet.

In addition to following the steps in "Workspace Organization and
General Cleanliness," follow these practices to maintain a sterile work
environment in a biological safety cabinet:

a.  Verify that the hood is on and the air is circulating.

b.  Lower or raise the sash to the calibration mark (if applicable).

c.  If the biological safety cabinet is equipped with a germicidal
    > ultraviolet lamp (UV), never work with the UV on, and the sash
    > raised. Doing so can cause permanent eye damage and severe burns.

d.  Clean the inside of the biological safety cabinet before and after
    > every use with bleach, alcohol, or another disinfectant. Check the
    > user manual: some grades of stainless steel are susceptible to
    > corrosion by bleach and certain disinfectants. If using alcohol,
    > isopropanol may be preferred over ethanol because the higher
    > evaporation rate of the latter can create potentially explosive
    > vapors inside a biological safety cabinet with air recirculation.

e.  Do not block airflow.

    -   Do not block the front or the back airflow slots with equipment
        > or supplies.

    -   Work at least six inches inside the hood.

    -   Do not sit with your body flush against the hood.

f.  Never use a flame inside a cabinet. Dust filled air filters are
    > extremely flammable.

g.  Have the cabinet inspected and certified regularly (e.g., annually)
    > for safety and integrity of the airflow.

4.  **Sterilizing equipment and reagents.**

    a.  **Autoclaving.** Using a steam autoclave provides a rapid method
        > for sterilizing almost anything except substances sensitive to
        > heat. A temperature higher than the boiling point of water
        > inside the autoclave (super-heating of liquids) is achieved
        > because the system is under pressure. Typical autoclaving
        > conditions of 121°C (250°F) for 15 minutes at 103 kPa (15 psi)
        > are sufficient to kill virtually all forms of life, including
        > bacterial endospores, and will inactivate viruses. The time of
        > the sterilization cycle should be modified according to the
        > amount and type of loaded items (see [[Autoclave
        > protocol]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit)
        > here). A commercial pressure cooker can be used successfully
        > as a DIY autoclave, but be aware that not all brands are able
        > to achieve the 15 psi continuous pressure that is standard for
        > sterilization. [[Swenson et al,
        > 2018]{.ul}](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208769)
        > assesses a range of commercially available pressure cookers as
        > autoclaves. [[Review their

        > when selecting a brand.

    b.  **Microwave oven.** [[Reports have
        > shown]{.ul}](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/sterilization/other-methods.html)
        > that heating materials in a microwave can be a surprisingly
        > effective method for sterilization; however, some resistant
        > bacterial spores may require several minutes of microwave
        > exposure, which may not be practical when preparing liquid
        > media. Although autoclaving should still be considered the
        > gold standard, some labs routinely sterilize bacterial or
        > plant growth media using a microwave oven. Make sure to use an
        > oversized flask and heat the flask in short increments while
        > watching continuously for signs of overboiling. Be aware that
        > superheated liquids may flash boil when taken out of the
        > microwave Although microwaving may be more convenient and
        > faster than using an autoclave, it does require closer
        > supervision and may be more likely to cause injury. Never
        > place metals in a microwave and include at least a small
        > container with water when using a kitchen microwave to
        > sterilize dry goods to avoid fire risk. Note: Always refer to
        > the manufacturer's instructions before using a microwave for
        > sterilization purposes.

    c.  **Dry oven sterilization.** Some items can be sterilized in a
        > lab oven. This method takes much longer for the heat to be
        > transferred to the organism. A temperature of 160°C for ≥2 hr
        > or 170°C for 1 hr is routinely used. The procedure cannot be
        > applied for liquids, rubber, or any plastic objects. However,
        > the method has advantages. For example, it can be used for
        > powders and other heat-stable items that are adversely
        > affected by steam, and it does not cause rusting of steel
        > objects. It is also a method of choice for the treatment of
        > glassware used for work with ribonucleic acid (RNA), since the
        > process of baking not only kills organisms, but also
        > inactivates any residual RNA-degrading enzymes (RNases).

    d.  **Filter sterilization.** Reagents such as antibiotics, drugs,
        > sugars, amino acids, vitamins, and complex media that are
        > either flammable or would be denatured by heat are usually
        > filter sterilized. Filter sterilization may also be convenient
        > to quickly prepare small amounts of liquid media without
        > having to run an entire autoclave cycle. Most living organisms
        > are retained by a 0.45-μm filter; this size filter is often
        > used as a prefilter because it also clears the liquid of
        > larger particulates. However, because some bacteria can pass
        > through 0.45-μm pores, a 0.22-μm filter should be used to
        > ensure sterilization of the fluids. Viruses will pass through
        > 0.22-μm filters, although they generally stick to the
        > membrane.

5.  **Techniques for maintaining sterile conditions.**

> Note: Working in an aseptic manner may take longer than when being
> less cautious. Be sure to plan ahead and reserve extra time to avoid
> being rushed (which could lead to spilling or breaking important
> samples, dishes, or solutions).

a.  **Manipulating vessels with liquid.** Most manipulations of cultures
    > or sterile reagents in tubes, bottles, or flasks should be
    > performed as follows:

    -   Loosen closures (e.g., lids, caps) of all containers prior to
        > any manipulations. This will ensure that a procedure will not
        > have to

> be stopped midway.

-   Hold the container in the non-dominant hand at a 45 degree angle, so
    > that dust cannot fall in when it is open.

-   Hold the instrument to be used for manipulation (e.g., inoculating
    > loop, pipet, needle, toothpick) in your dominant hand.

-   Grasp the container closure using the little finger of your dominant
    > hand and lift from the container. Do not set the container closure
    > down. Doing so increases the risk of it becoming contaminated from
    > the bench top. Remember that even a clean bench top is not
    > sterile.

-   Quickly manipulate the instrument into the container and then
    > withdraw it.

-   If working with a flame and glass bottles or tubes, the container
    > opening can be flamed immediately after uncapping it and then
    > again right before closing it.

-   Replace the container closure immediately.

b.  **Using inoculating instruments.**

    -   If using a flame, incinerator, and a metal loop or needle:

        1.  Place the junction between the loop wire and the handle just
            > above the inner blue cone (hottest point) until the wire
            > turns red.

        2.  Slowly draw the wire through the blue flame, making sure
            > that every part of the wire is heated to glowing red. The
            > loop tip is heated last.

        3.  Cool the loop by making contact with another sterile surface
            > (e.g., an unused section of an agar plate). Do not blow on
            > the loop or wave it in the air to cool it as this will
            > contaminate the loop.

        4.  The loop is now ready for immediate use. Do not put the loop
            > down or touch it to a non-sterile surface before using.

        5.  Flame the loop again immediately after use before setting it
            > down.

    -   Plastic, disposable loops are available either individually
        > wrapped or packaged in bulk.

        1.  Carefully remove an individual loop without contaminating
            > the remaining loops.

        2.  For bulk-packed instruments, gently shake them out of their
            > container rather than reaching in to take one.

        3.  Toothpicks that have been autoclaved are an alternative
            > instruments that can be used to transfer microorganisms to
            > culture media.

    -   "Hockey-stick" cell spreaders or sterile glass beads can be used
        > to spread bacteria from a liquid culture onto an agar plate.

        1.  With a sterile pipette, transfer the desired amount of
            > liquid culture onto the plate.

        2.  Very gently tap out 4-5 beads onto the plate, and gently
            > move the plate around in a back and forth, and side to
            > side horizontal motion to spread the bacteria.

        3.  Use of glass beads (aka the [[Copacabana
            > method]{.ul}](https://www.jove.com/video/3064/aseptic-laboratory-techniques-plating-methods))
            > can be hard to control, and beads have a tendency to
            > bounce out of their intended container and may
            > accidentally be spilled inside of a biological safety
            > cabinet or onto the floor.

        4.  Because of the risk of cross-contamination, even in
            > experienced hands, some labs discourage the use of glass
            > beads.

c.  **Using petri dishes.** If a biological safety cabinet is not
    > available, it is acceptable to pour media into petri dishes on the
    > open benchtop. So long as the benchtop is sterilized, the area is
    > relatively free of airborne particles, and the media is not
    > hazardous.

    -   Before pouring media into sterile petri dishes, first remove the
        > plates from their container (e.g., plastic sleeve) and arrange
        > them on the lab bench.

    -   Remove petri dish lids only when needed for pouring the media
        > and close immediately after.

    -   When the lid is removed, it should be held over the plate as a
        > shield, with as small of an opening as necessary and never
        > placed on the bench top.

    -   For all manipulations of cultures in petri dishes, lids should
        > be lifted for as short a time as possible.

    -   Do not walk around the room with an open plate.

    -   As with all other media, do not breathe on open plates.

> Note: If a biological safety cabinet is available, pour the plates
> inside the cabinet. Because of the sterile environment created with
> the biological safety cabinet, it is acceptable to leave the lid
> partially open to avoid condensation that might form on the top of the
> lid while the hot media is cooling. Whether poured in a biological
> safety cabinet, or on the open bench, the plates should always be
> stored inverted (lid down) to prevent any condensation from dropping
> onto the media. Some labs may use glass petri dishes rather than
> plastic and these can be treated in the same way.

Disinfectants and Their Proper Use
----------------------------------

There are many disinfectant choices in the marketplace. When making a
decision, be aware of the difference between disinfectants with the
prefix *cide* vs. *static*:

-   *cide* means that it kills (e.g., bactericide \[= germicide\]
    > destroys vegetative bacteria only).

-   *static* means that it prohibits growth but may not kill (e.g.,
    > bacteriostatic prevents growth of vegetative bacteria).

The most commonly used disinfectant in labs is household bleach, also
known as sodium hypochlorite. Other disinfectants include ethanol (i.e.,
ethyl alcohol) and isopropanol (i.e., isopropyl alcohol or IPA).

For alcohols, a 70% dilution is optimal and is more effective than 91%
or 99%. Likewise, a 1:10 dilution of household bleach (e.g., one part
Clorox bleach in 9 parts water) is optimal and is more effective than
undiluted bleach.

Be aware that not all bleach is the same concentration so check the
bottle. You should aim for 5-8% sodium hypochlorite. Diluted bleach is
not very stable---use your diluted solution within 24 hours and store
away from light. After a shelf life of six months, even concentrated
bleach starts to degrade and becomes 20% less effective each year. Don't
use several-year old bleach and expect it to be effective.

Note that all disinfectants require a certain contact time for optimal
efficacy. A brief wipe with a moist paper towel may not be sufficient;
surfaces should be kept visibly wet for several minutes for optimal
efficacy. Isopropanol evaporates slower than ethanol, allowing for a
longer contact time with less chance for flammability.

The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has developed useful
information about the properties of various disinfectants and some
factors to consider when selecting one (see Tables below for more
information). For a detailed description of proper disinfectants and
techniques see [[Disinfection
101]{.ul}](http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Disinfection/Assets/Disinfection101.pdf).

Identifying Contamination
-------------------------

Here are some tips for identifying and addressing contamination:

-   Uninoculated liquid media should always be clear. If there is any
    > hint of opaqueness or floating debris it is likely from
    > contamination. If contaminated, the media should be bleached or
    > autoclaved before being disposed of appropriately.

-   When looking at microbes growing on agar plates, make sure that
    > there is only one colony type. The shape, texture, and
    > pigmentation should all be the same. Note that older colonies may
    > be larger and sometimes have a slightly different pigmentation,
    > though not very different. Slower-growing organisms tend to become
    > contaminated more often than faster growing organisms.

-   If there is obvious mold growing on the plate, it may be possible to
    > revive the sample by picking an isolated colony and culturing it.
    > However, mold spores, not visible to the naked eye, may still be
    > present. If possible, it's best to dispose of the plate and start
    > anew.

-   Yeast cultures can sometimes become contaminated with bacteria (it
    > is usually not the other way around). It can be difficult to
    > notice, but if anything seems strange with the smell or color of
    > the yeast, throwing it away may be the safest route. Note that the
    > smell is something that might be apparent, but it is not
    > recommended that individuals regularly sniff cultures! If
    > possible, having separate working sections in the lab for yeast
    > and bacteria can reduce the chances of contamination.

**When It Comes to Contamination, "When in Doubt, Throw It Out!"**

It may be tempting to isolate contaminants by restreaking them on agar
plates. However, isolation of unknown organisms inherently falls outside
BSL-1 and should be strongly discouraged in most community labs.
Contaminant organisms often originate from spore-forming bacteria or
molds that could significantly raise contamination levels throughout the
lab when grown in larger quantities.

Other important sources of contaminants are the researchers themselves,
e.g., in the form of an errant spit droplet from talking while streaking
plates. In this case, isolating a human microbiome strain risks
amplifying an opportunistic pathogen to the point where it can pose a
hazard to others in the lab.

Some sequencing companies offer a colony PCR service, which allows
identification of bacterial or yeast strains by DNA barcoding from as
little as a single colony. This may allow identification of contaminants
without having to culture them further. However, opening of contaminated
plates should always be discouraged, since it increases the risk of
further contamination or exposure to pathogens.

Disposal
--------

All microbial waste should be inactivated and disposed of appropriately
after use. It is a good practice to inactivate liquid waste by adding
bleach to a final concentration of 10% and allowing it to soak for at
least 10 minutes before disposing of it down the drain. Solid waste can
be inactivated by autoclaving.

Waste disposal laws vary by state or local jurisdiction. In some cases,
[[BSL-1]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit#heading=h.onrp8ir4edeq)
waste may be disposed of as Municipal Solid Waste (also known as regular
trash) if it has been autoclaved or otherwise inactivated. If working
with
[[BSL-2]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit#heading=h.onrp8ir4edeq)
waste, in most localities it must be labeled with a biohazard symbol
(e.g., a red bag with a biohazard symbol). We recommend reaching out to
a nearby university, a biotechnology company, or waste disposal service
for advice and assistance.

Sourcing Organisms of Interest
------------------------------

For more information on sourcing microbes see the [[Acquiring,
Transferring, and Shipping
Materials]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#heading=h.v0cbjdpm14m6)
chapter. This chapter focuses on isolating organisms from a mixed
source.

**Isolating Microbial Strains**
-------------------------------

*Isolation* refers to the process of deriving pure single-strain
("axenic") cultures from a mixed culture, typically by restreaking
colonies on agar plates. Since you don't know from the start which
strains you will wind up with, and how safe those strains will be to
work with, we recommend you use BSL-2 practices and facilities when
isolating unknowns. (Note that for educational purposes, it is possible
to buy or make mixtures of known safe strains to teach the isolation
procedure safely in a BSL-1 environment.)

However, in practice, biosafety is built on a foundation of
situation-specific risk assessment. Academic or commercial labs have an
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) that can allow some types of
experiments to be performed in what is technically a BSL-1 lab using
BSL-2 work practices for specific, well-described experiments and/or
projects with site-specific risk assessments and work practices.

For example, Counter Culture Labs drew up a set of biosafety guidelines
to allow [[isolation of microbial strains from fermented
foods]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12f3g_TilA91P5Xd98ulQSA2K7lzv37zBQxqLBl9Njms/edit#heading=h.9tj0i9rqbpou)
in a BSL-1 laboratory under a strict set of conditions, by layering
additional safeguards on top of each other. Briefly:

1.  Only food-safe starter material is allowed.

2.  All the work with the isolate has to happen inside the biosafety
    > cabinet.

3.  No incubation at or around body temperature (between 30°C and 42°C)
    > to bias against incubating human pathogens.

4.  All cultures need to be sealed with parafilm and stored inside a
    > secondary container (e.g., ziplock bag) when outside the BSC
    > (fridge, freezer, incubator).

5.  No other work shall be done with the isolates until they have been
    > fully identified and judged to be safe by the biosafety committee.

Note that a thorough isolation process can be quite lengthy and involve
restreaking dozens of plates over the course of several weeks, each of
which carries a small chance of contamination. So even starting from a
known safe mixed culture, it is not uncommon to isolate contaminant
strains along with the target strains---hence the need to keep isolates
well contained until identified.

Identification of newly isolated strains used to involve an arduous
process of looking up microscopic and biochemical characteristics in
published tables. However, in the current era of cheap sequencing, the
fastest and easiest approach (and the one involving least exposure to an
as yet unknown isolate) is by DNA barcoding. In this method, one or more
carefully chosen marker genes are amplified by PCR and then typically
sequenced by Sanger sequencing. For risk assessment purposes, we
recommend sequencing at least the full length 16S gene for bacteria or
the full ITS region for fungi.

Factors to consider (and document) for risk assessment:

-   Exactly what was the source material for this isolate?

-   What medium, temperature, antibiotics and other conditions was it
    > isolated under?

-   What sequence evidence (and quality scores) do we have for its
    > identification?

-   What is the closest BLAST hit against all known sequences (e.g.,
    > NCBI's NR nucleotide database)?

-   What is the closest hit against a set of reference sequences with
    > well-curated species names (e.g., NCBI's 16S database or multiple
    > sequence alignment using SILVA)?

-   What are the risk group assignments for these closest hits (e.g., by
    > searching ATCC or DSMZ or based on a thorough literature search)?

-   Does this genus or family contain known human pathogens or clinical
    > isolates (e.g., by searching ATCC or DSMZ for BSL-2 strains or
    > based on a thorough literature search)? If so, how close are these
    > known pathogens to your isolate?

| A community lab in Europe recently received a bioluminescent strain  |
| that had been isolated in this manner and had already been passed    |
| around several labs as *Vibrio harveyi*. However, upon sequencing    |
| they discovered it was in fact [*[Vibrio                             |
| vulnificus]{.ul}*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_vulnificus), |
| a Risk Group 2 species that has previously been associated with a    |
| fatal wound infection.                                               |

| biosafety cabinet!*                                                  |

**15. Animal Safety**
=====================

**Introduction**
----------------

Animals are an entire kingdom of the [[Tree of
Life]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology))
covering a very broad range of organisms of differing sizes, with
different care requirements and safety considerations. However, only a
small range of species are typically used as model organisms in biology.
Two common species likely to be found in community labs are the common
fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) and nematode worms
(*Caenorhabditis elegans*). This chapter offers specific advice on
common types of lab animals used in community labs along with general
safety tips.

Animal-based research presents unique hazards and should always adhere
to basic [[biological
safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/)
principles and [[risk
assessment]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/)
procedures. For example, animals may bite, scratch, sting, cause
allergic reactions and/or harbor infectious diseases. The fact that
animals are mobile and may swim, walk or fly presents special
containment challenges compared to the limited motility of most microbes
and plants. In addition, for some animal species and particularly
vertebrates, there exist unique legal and ethical considerations that
are not invoked for research with other organisms.

Ethics of Animal Use
--------------------

Most countries have animal research ethics guidelines or legislation to
regulate the scientific use of vertebrates (e.g., fish, mammals, birds).
For example, the [[UK's Animal (Scientific Procedures)
Act]{.ul}](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/animalresearch/legislation/legislation.aspx)
regulates "any experimental or other scientific procedure\...which may
have the effect of causing that animal pain, suffering, distress or
lasting harm."

Some countries also include cephalopods (e.g., cuttlefish, octopus) and
decapod crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, and prawns). The rationale
for this inclusion is that all vertebrates and many invertebrates
possess the neurophysiological components necessary to receive,
transmit, process, and remember painful stimuli ([[The Ethics of
Research Involving
Animals]{.ul}](http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/The-ethics-of-research-involving-animals-full-report.pdf)).

Some important ethical considerations include the welfare of animals
through good husbandry practices and minimization of pain through use of
anesthesia during any experimental procedures and humane methods of
euthanasia. While most animal research legislation does not extend to
insects (with exceptions for bees) or other less complex invertebrate
animals; it is good practice that they are also reared and maintained
with care and anesthetized or euthanized prior to invasive procedures.

There are numerous guides for the ethical use of animals in research,
including the [[2011 National Academics Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54045/)
and the [[2006 National Academies Guide to Principles and Guidelines for
the Use of Animals in]{.ul} [Precollege]{.ul}
[Education]{.ul}](https://nabt.org/files/galleries/Principles_and_Guidelines_for_the_Use_of_Animals_in_Precollege_Education.pdf).
The latter includes ten principles that we have adapted for community
labs.

**Principle 1:** When an intrusive study of a living organism is deemed
appropriate, first consider using plants or invertebrates with no,
minimal, or primitive nervous systems. Intrusive studies of vertebrates
and invertebrates with advanced nervous systems should be conducted only
when absolutely necessary for the experiment.

**Principle 2:** Supervision must be provided by individuals who are
knowledgeable about and experienced with the health, husbandry, care,
and handling of the animal species used and who understand applicable
laws, regulations, policies, and ethics.

**Principle 3:** Appropriate care for animals must be provided,
including appropriate food, water, housing, temperature, and lighting.

**Principle 4:** Animals should be healthy and free of diseases that can
be transmitted to humans or to other animals unless required for the
experiment. Veterinary care must be provided as needed.

**Principle 5:** Lab members must report all scratches, bites, and other
injuries, allergies, or illnesses immediately to the community lab
Safety Team.

**Principle 6:** Lab members must not conduct experimental procedures on
regulated animals that:

1)  Are likely to cause pain, discomfort, or interfere with an animal\'s
    > health or well-being (note that procedures that cause pain in
    > humans are considered to cause pain in other vertebrates).

2)  Induce nutritional deficiencies or toxicities.

3)  Expose animals to microorganisms, ionizing radiation,
    > cancer-producing agents, or any other harmful drugs or chemicals
    > capable of causing disease, injury, or birth defects in humans or
    > animals.

**Principle 7:** Behavioral conditioning studies should not involve
unpleasant stimuli wherever possible. In studies using positive
reinforcement, animals should not be deprived of water. Food deprivation
intervals should be appropriate for the species.

**Principle 8:** A written plan for conducting an experiment with living
animals must be prepared and approved by the community lab Safety Team
prior to initiating the experiment or to obtaining the animals. If your
community lab is housed in a university or research institution,
projects will need to be reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC). The plan should include a justification for the
use of the species and consideration of why a less complex organism was
not appropriate.

We recommend including in your committee someone with experience on an
institutional review board or ethics committee in an organization that
reviews animal research, a veterinaria, or lay members drawn from the
local community who have had ethics training. Some examples of ethics
training resources include: [[Animal Ethic
Training]{.ul}](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-animal-ethics-2),
[[NIH ethics
training]{.ul}](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/air/training_events.htm),
and [[Care Video
Series]{.ul}](https://www.apa.org/research/responsible/care-video).

Risk Assessment and Training
----------------------------

Here are five questions to ask before starting to work with a particular
animal in the lab:

**Do You Need to Use Live Animals?**

When considering the use of animals in research and particularly
vertebrates and cephalopods, we recommend that you consider the three
R's rules (reduction, replacement, and refinement). This involves
ensuring that the number of animals used in the experiments is necessary
(reduction), considering alternatives to live animals in experiments
(replacement), and adopting experimental methods that minimize distress
to the animals (refinement). Live animals should only be used when there
are no viable alternatives.

**Is It a Vertebrate or Invertebrate?**

In most countries, the use of vertebrates (animals with backbones, such
as mice and fish) for research, teaching, or testing using procedures
that may cause adverse effects such as "pain, suffering, distress, or
lasting harm," is subject to legal restrictions and regulations. In many
cases this requires a license for both the lab and the researcher. The
use of mammals (e.g., mice, rats) is not recommended in community labs,
and any use of vertebrate animals should be carefully considered.

Most invertebrates are typically not covered by animal research
regulations but in some regions (e.g., the EU), cephalopods, such as
octopus, are covered. Community labs should carefully plan for the
welfare and humane treatment of any cephalopods or other invertebrates
used in their activities.

**Does the Animal Harbor Human or Animal Disease?**

Many animals, such as mosquitoes or ticks, provide reservoirs for human
disease or can transmit infectious agents that may affect humans and
other species (referred to as zoonoses). Higher levels of containment is
required for these types of species. In general, the biosafety level
recommended for working with infectious agents in animals is the same as
that for working with the agents themselves (typically BSL-2 or higher).
Therefore, if your lab conforms to BSL-2 and the potential pathogens
from a particular species are also classified as BSL-2, then it may be
possible to use the animals, subject to a full risk assessment and
appropriate controls being put in place.

We strongly discourage community labs from using animals capable of
harboring human or zoonotic disease. Risks of disease transmission
should also be considered for insects or other wild animals collected
from the wild or for ecological work.

**Is It Native to the Local Area?**

Use of "alien" or "exotic" animals and potentially invasive species that
are not native to the local area must be avoided. Always consider
containment measures for this purpose and ensure that animals cultured
in the lab are not on local invasive species lists. Note that these
species, along with others such as threatened and endangered species,
will typically also be subject to [[import and transport
controls]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#heading=h.lcn700cgbm4u).
In the U.S., the [[Department of
Agriculture]{.ul}](https://www.usda.gov), [[Animal and Plant Health
Inspection]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/), [[Fish and
Wildlife Service]{.ul}](https://www.fws.gov), among others, monitor
invasive and imported species. There are also different rules at the
state and federal level.

**Is the Animal Genetically Modified or Will It Be Genetically
Modified?**

Wild-type animals are generally not subject to containment or disposal
regulations as long as they are indigenous to the local area. However,
genetically modified (or GM) animals should always be contained and
properly disposed. In many cases, measures will be the same as for
microbes, requiring lab containment, then killing the organism and
chemically deactivating or autoclaving prior to disposal. The major
difference is the increased mobility of animals that may require further
engineering containment controls (e.g., screens and fly traps to avoid
escaped GM *Drosophila* flying out of the lab). A comprehensive guide to
risk assessment for GM animals can be found in the UK's [[SACGM Chapter
5]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part5.pdf).
For work in the U.S., see the [[NIH
Guidelines]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.pdf).

**Are There Any Other Risks Associated with the Animal?**

These could include:

-   Stinging, biting, and scratching.

-   Toxin production.

    -   Several arthropods and marine creatures produce toxins (e.g.,
        > centipedes, caterpillars, sea anemones).

    -   Using these animals requires careful consideration of handling
        > and risk to experimenters from both the live animal and any
        > samples collected from them.

-   Feces or fecal pellets. Scat and feces from animals can carry
    > infectious diseases to humans. The fecal matter should be handled
    > and disposed of properly.

Animal Containment
------------------

Containment measures should be considered by asking two questions:

-   "What happens if the animal escapes?"

-   "What can be done to minimize the risk of the animal escaping?"

Animal Containment Levels (ACLs) generally map onto the standard
[[Biosafety
Levels]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/).
The following questions are designed for [[arthropod
research]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694736) (see
[[Arthropod Containment Guidelines, Version
3.2]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694736), American
Committee Of Medical Entomology), but they provide a good starting point
for assessing all animal containment requirements. The [[UK SACGM
Chapter
5]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part5.pdf)
also offers comprehensive guidelines for risk assessment and containment
of GM animals:

-   Is the species already established in the local area?

-   If the species is alien to the area, is it likely that it would
    > become established in the event of accidental escape? If the
    > climate and locally available food is incompatible then the risk
    > is low, such as tropical mosquitoes accidentally being released in
    > a temperate winter.

-   Could an escape be controlled by common methods or does the species
    > have a known or characterized resistance to those methods (e.g.,
    > insecticide resistance).

-   Does the species transmit any infectious agents and are those
    > infectious agents likely to be present in the local environment
    > (e.g., does an animal reservoir for a known zoonosis exist
    > locally)?

-   Would accidental release of the arthropod significantly increase any
    > public health risk to humans and animals?

-   Does the species have an enhanced ability compared to local
    > populations to transmit infectious agents or cause harm?

-   Are strains available that have been genetically disabled to limit
    > their viability outside of the lab (e.g., wingless or cold
    > sensitive)?

If the organism can transmit diseases and its infection status is
unknown (e.g., it was collected from the wild), further risk assessment
should consider:

-   Why is an infectious agent suspected? How likely is it? Many
    > arboviruses are present at very low levels in arthropod
    > populations (e.g., one in a thousand individuals carries the virus
    > and even then, the potential dose may be too small to generate a
    > viable infection).

-   What route of transmission is indicated? Is there horizontal or
    > vertical transfer? The risk from processed samples may be very low
    > compared to being bitten and certain life stages may not carry
    > disease.

-   What is the morbidity or mortality rate associated with the agent?

It may not be necessary to take the most conservative approach to
samples of unknown infection status, and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) [[2012 Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human
and Animal Medical Diagnostic
Laboratories]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396570/#B9)
provides a comprehensive guide to nuanced risk assessments in this
scenario.

Regulations
-----------

Regulation of animal research differs by locations and sources of
funding. Always check local policies and laws in detail prior to using
animals.

### United States

The USDA [[Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare
Regulations]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/AC_BlueBook_AWA_FINAL_2017_508comp.pdf)
(AWRs) apply to all mammals, with the exception of lab mice and rats
bred for the purpose of research. If using regulated animals, these
activities are subject to review and approval by an Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). That IACUC reports to the NIH Office of
Laboratory Animal Welfare. As previously mentioned, many institutions
include external members, such as lay people from the local community
who undergo training, as part of their IACUC.

Those in receipt of [[federal funding from the
U.S.]{.ul}](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_4/4.1.1_animal_welfare_requirements.htm)
are required to follow additional policies and ensure their animal care
programs cover "any live, vertebrate animal used or intended for use in
research, research training, experimentation, or biological testing or
for related purposes." Consideration should be given to the following
resources:

-   [[Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
    > Animals]{.ul}](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf)

-   [[American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines on
    > Euthanasia]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf)

-   [[U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of
    > Vertebrate Animals Use in Testing, Research and
    > Training]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54048/)

For privately funded science there is no additional oversight at a
federal level, but you should check other federal, state, and local
laws, regulations, and policies and consider voluntarily adhering to
more stringent guidelines. Additional guidance and a voluntary
accreditation program is available through the [[Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)
International]{.ul}](http://www.aaalac.org/).

Remember that the animal itself and the nature of the procedure might
bring the work under other regulations (e.g., on imports of exotic
species, use of infectious organisms, genetic modification, medical
treatment).

### Europe

Work with animals is governed by [[Directive
2010/63/EU]{.ul}](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:en:PDF)
revising [[Directive
86/609/EEC]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12513679) on the
[[protection of
animals]{.ul}](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm)
used for scientific purposes. The Directive is firmly based on the
principle of the Three Rs, to replace, reduce and refine the use of
animals used for scientific purposes. The legislation covers non-human
vertebrate species (including independently feeding larval forms and
last trimester fetal forms of mammals) and
[[cephalopods]{.ul}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod) used for
the purposes of basic research, higher education, and training.

Article 3, Section 1 of [[Directive
2010/63/EU]{.ul}](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0063&from=EN)
defines a regulated "procedure" as:

*"any use, invasive or non-invasive, of an animal for experimental or
other scientific purposes, with known or unknown outcome, or educational
purposes, which may cause the animal a level of pain, suffering,
distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by
the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary
practice. This includes any course of action intended, or liable, to
result in the birth or hatching of an animal or the creation and
maintenance of a genetically modified animal line in any such condition,
but excludes the killing of animals solely for the use of their organs
or tissues."*

The legislation is driven by the Three R's so all use of animals in
research must be justified, explaining why a non-animal could not be
used instead.

Member States are required to ensure that each breeder, supplier and
user sets up an animal-welfare body. The animal-welfare body for
laboratory organizations should include at least the person or persons
responsible for the welfare and care of the animals and a scientific
member. The animal-welfare body must also receive input from a
designated veterinarian or other suitably qualified expert, who can
advise on the well-being and treatment of the animals.

Licensing is very stringent in many Member States. For example, in the
UK, any researcher using vertebrates (including frogs and fish) must
have three licenses from the Home Office:

1.  An establishment licence covering the organization

2.  A project license for the research program

3.  A personal license for all people using the animals

The licenses are only authorized if there are no suitable alternatives
that replace animal use, reduce the number of animals needed, or refine
the procedures used to cause less suffering. Due to these stringent
regulations, it is not recommended that community labs in Europe use
vertebrate organisms.

Training
--------

Once a risk assessment has been completed and controls put in place,
training should be offered to researchers working with the animals to
ensure they are able to maintain and contain them appropriately with
regard for lab hygiene and animal welfare and fulfil all of the
regulations covering their work. People with no experience working with
the organism should ideally collaborate with a more experienced member
or an expert.

Hygiene
-------

A major concern for animal research is maintaining good hygiene to avoid
contamination of the animal cultures and the lab environment. Good
hygiene also reduces the risk of developing allergies or allergic
reactions, which are often made worse by the accumulation of waste and
detritus. Consider the following to improve hygiene when working with
animals:

-   Sterile technique should be used when necessary (e.g., when
    > subculturing nematode worms). Use similar techniques to good
    > microbiological practice, such as the use of microbiological
    > safety cabinets for preparing media or good aseptic technique and
    > disposable or frequently sterilized equipment.

-   Use disposable culture vessels (e.g., tubes, plates, dishes) and
    > frequently wash any reusable cages or tubes with disinfectant such
    > as bleach. In some cases, culture vessels may be autoclavable.

-   Experimenters should be vigilant to avoid contamination which may
    > include: feces, fungi and bacteria; mites and other arthropods;
    > molds; and cross-contamination between cultures.

-   Destroy contaminated cultures through chemical disinfection or
    > autoclaving as soon as they are identified. Notify other lab users
    > in case the problem has already spread to other animal cultures.

It is recommended to separate any new animal cultures coming into the
lab and check for contamination before storing alongside existing ones.
For example, *Drosophila* mites can be a major problem and are often
carried between facilities by movement or sharing of contaminated
cultures.

Allergies
---------

Up to a [[quarter of people]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/eh76.pdf)
who regularly work with small mammals and insects develop an [[allergic
response]{.ul}](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/eh76.pdf), usually as a
result of [[contact with proteins that
animals]{.ul}](https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/documents/laapp.pdf)
secrete in their waste or by shedding skin, fur, and scales. This
typically causes minor but irritating symptoms such as an itchy nose or
watering eyes, but asthma or serious anaphylactic shock can also occur.
All persons working with lab animals should be considered at risk, even
if allergy has never been a problem before.

Water-dwelling animals, such as Daphnia (water flea) or tardigrades and
nematode worms, are not typically a high risk for allergies as the water
or culture medium reduces airborne allergens. Insects, such as
*Drosophila* and particularly butterflies and moths (whose wing scales
have been shown to cause allergies), are higher risk. Mammalian species
with dander or fur are also a much higher risk. We strongly discourage
the use of mammals in community labs.

Most community labs do not have occupational health screening programs.
However, if members are acting in formal roles such as lab manager or
trainer and their work involves handling animals, the community lab may
be legally required to provide screening to those employees. Always
check local regulations for occupational health screening requirements.
All members should be encouraged to self-report problems, and safety
officers should proactively follow up at regular intervals and encourage
members to seek advice from medical professionals if problems arise. Any
issues will require a revision of the risk assessment and in some cases
may mean the member discontinues work with the organism to which they
develop an allergy.

There are several actions you can take to lower the risk of allergies
arising and allergic reactions occuring:

**Handling and Husbandry**

-   Handling of animals should be kept to a minimum and always performed
    > in accordance with the risk assessment and standard operating
    > procedure for the project.

-   Covered boxes, tubes, cages, or tanks should be used for housing
    > animals and cleaned or replaced on a regular basis. Surfaces
    > around animal work areas should also be frequently cleaned.

-   Use "dust-free" bedding or material (e.g., in rearing beetles,
    > cockroaches, or other insects).

-   Preference water-dwelling animals which do not generate dust or
    > aerosols.

-   Ensure good ventilation in rooms housing animals with low humidity
    > and good air flow. If the animal requires high humidity, consider
    > a cabinet rather than humidifying a room to minimize issues with
    > mold.

-   Any waste should be promptly bagged and disposed of via the
    > appropriate route.

**Personal Protective Equipment**

-   Wear gloves when handling or working with animals and
    > [[dispose]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/)
    > of them after the task is completed to avoid spreading allergens
    > around the lab.

-   Regularly wash hands and moisturize.

-   Wear a lab coat and launder it frequently. If an animal sheds
    > allergens (e.g., moth scales or insects that form dry dust in
    > their cages), consider a disposable lab coat that is only used for
    > animal-related tasks.

-   If a respiratory allergy develops, a respirator mask may be required
    > to continue working with the allergen. The use of a respirator
    > must conform to local standards and be properly face-fitted to the
    > person in order to be effective, and this may not be realistic to
    > achieve in a community lab setting.

Disposal and Decontamination
----------------------------

Prior to obtaining animals, a plan must be in place for the end of the
project and disposal, which may include:

-   **Release:** Always check local regulations as wildlife and public
    > health officials may need to approve the capture and release of
    > some animals from and to the wild. If the organism is non-native,
    > GM, or infected, then this will not be a viable route of disposal.

-   **Euthanasia:** For invertebrates, this typically involves freezing
    > them, using carbon dioxide, or aneasthetising substances and then
    > putting in ethanol or other disinfectant. If using vertebrates or
    > other animals covered by regulations, when euthanasia is necessary
    > it should be performed by a trained person and in accordance with
    > the most recent recommendations. For example, in the U.S., the
    > [[American Veterinary Medical
    > Association]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Euthanasia-Guidelines.aspx)
    > provides guidelines for vertebrates and there are separate
    > guidelines for [[cephalopods in
    > research]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354955). The
    > [[UK Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred,
    > Supplied or Used for Scientific
    > Purposes]{.ul}](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-the-housing-and-care-of-animals-bred-supplied-or-used-for-scientific-purposes)
    > also provide detailed advice on euthanasia.

GM and potentially infected invertebrates should always be processed as
biological waste, including chemical disinfection or autoclaving.
Non-recombinant or wildtype invertebrates can typically be disposed of
into the regular trash once they have been euthanized. However, all
biological organisms used in the lab should be disposed of through the
standard biological waste stream to avoid confusion.

Common Types of Lab Animals
---------------------------

### Arthropods (e.g. *Drosophila melanogaster*)

**Containment**

Arthropod Containment Level 1 (ACL-1) is suitable for work with
non-vector arthropods, uninfected arthropod vectors, or those infected
with a nonpathogen. This would include native arthropods regardless of
whether there is disease transmission in the area and exotic or alien
arthropods that would be: (a) nonviable or (b) only capable of becoming
temporarily established in an area with no active disease transmission.
ACL-1 would include most uses of arthropods including arthropod vectors
in community labs.

*Location and Housing*

-   Arthropods should be located out of the flow of general traffic and
    > ideally in environmental chambers or incubators.

-   The area around arthropod containers should be kept clean and free
    > of clutter to easily allow identification, recapture, or killing
    > of escaped individuals.

-   Cages and other culture containers should be cleaned regularly after
    > being heated or chilled to a lethal temperature for any remaining
    > arthropods or eggs.

-   Cages should be robust and prevent escape at all life stages (e.g.,
    > mesh screens should be durable and small enough to prevent even
    > the smallest individuals from escaping). Use of bags and rearing
    > trays to add additional leak prevention is encouraged. Vessels
    > containing stages with limited mobility (e.g., eggs, pupae,
    > hibernating adults) should be labeled and sufficient to prevent
    > escape of a mobile form following development. Cages and

*Escape and Entrance Procedure*

-   All life stages of arthropods must be killed before disposal.

    > ethanol, or freezing before being placed into trash bags.

-   Furniture and racks should be minimized and be easily moved to
    > permit easy cleaning and location of escaped arthropods.

Arthropods known or suspected to be harboring BSL-2 level infectious
agents will typically be treated as BSL-2. These infectious agents are
not recommended for use in community labs due to the risk of disease
infection and transmission.

**Major Safety Considerations**

-   Risk of disease infection and transmission.

-   Allergies.

-   Bites and stings.

**Performing Procedures**

There is an ongoing debate about invertebrates' abilities to perceive
pain or otherwise experience compromised welfare. Before performing
experimental procedures, arthropods can be anaesthetised by use of
injected or inhaled anesthetics or by cooling them down in a
refrigerator or on ice. There is a lack of data on dosage levels,
timing, and efficacy of these methods across different species. However,
carbon dioxide or triethylamine-based anesthetics like FlyNap are very
commonly used with *Drosophila*.

**Euthanasia and Disposal**

The [[AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013
Edition]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf)
(pg. 75) states for captive invertebrates, "while there is ongoing
debate about invertebrates' abilities to perceive pain or otherwise
experience compromised welfare, the Guidelines assume that a
conservative and humane approach to the care of any creature is
warranted and expected by society. Consequently, euthanasia methods
should be used that minimize the potential for pain or distress. Most
commonly used methods involve terminal anesthesia, followed by physical
removal of the nervous system, to assure lack of sensory perception and
death of the animal."

Acceptable methods for captive invertebrates include:

-   Injectable euthanasia by potassium chloride or pentobarbital.

-   Inhaled anesthetics followed by physical or chemical methods (e.g.,
    > submersion in ethanol or freezing).

-   Carbon dioxide (no efficacy data for some species) followed by
    > physical or chemical methods (e.g., submersion in ethanol or
    > freezing).

Euthanized arthropods can then go through the standard biological waste
stream so long as they are filtered from flammable and toxic liquids
before autoclaving. It is common in fly work to collect anesthetized
flies in a bottle filled with ethanol (a "fly morgue" or "kill jar"). If
this method is used then the container should be leak-proof, wide
mouthed (or paired with a funnel), sealable, made of ethanol-rated
plastic, and clearly labelled. Dispose of the whole bottle via the
chemical waste stream or filter out the flies and reuse the ethanol
because flammable substances cannot be autoclaved. Ensure that funnels,
surfaces, tubes, and cages are all frozen then rinsed in ethanol or
disinfectant to avoid carryover of eggs and larvae.

### *C. elegans*, Tardigrades, and Other Water-Dwelling Invertebrates

**Containment**

Water-dwelling invertebrates do not have a specific set of containment
guidelines from an internationally recognized agency, but the principles
laid out earlier in this chapter apply. They are easier to contain than
organisms that walk or fly. Tanks and containers can be made very easily
from standard lab plasticware and food containers. If tanks are
connected to a main water supply, meshes should be used to ensure
organisms cannot escape. Cleaning procedures should be carefully
designed to minimize the risk of live animals being washed into drains
connected to main water supplies. Aquatic animals, including viable
fertilized eggs, should be kept in appropriate tanks fitted with filters
that are sufficient to retain the smallest organism or eggs likely to be
present.

Be aware that animals such as tardigrades and rotifers that are
desiccation resistant are very difficult to contain in their dried-out
state as they are extremely light and movable by air currents.

**Major Safety Considerations**

-   None additional to considerations pertaining to all animals.

**Euthanasia and Disposal**

The [[AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013
Edition]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf)
recommends a two-stage strategy for euthanizing aquatic
invertebrates---with chemical injection of anesthesia, followed by a
method that destroys the brain or major ganglia physically (e.g.,
pithing, freezing, boiling) or chemically (e.g., alcohol, formalin).
There are major differences across the phyla; check the literature for
each species.

**First Step**

-   Magnesium salts (note: ineffective for crustaceans). Different phyla
    > require a different concentration so check the literature.

-   Clove oil---this has been used effectively as an immersion agent for
    > the euthanasia of crustaceans at 0.125 mL/L.

-   Ethanol---this has been used for euthanasia of some phyla at a 1% to
    > 5% concentration.

**Second Step**

-   Pithing (i.e. piercing or severing the spinal cord)---requires
    > detailed anatomic knowledge of the species.

-   Freezing.

-   Boiling.

-   Immersion in 70% ethanol and neutral-buffered 10% formalin.

Euthanized invertebrates can go through the standard biological waste
stream so long as they are filtered from any flammable liquids before
autoclaving.

### Cephalopods

**Containment**

Cephalopods can be treated similarly to aquatic invertebrates although
they will need more rearing space and equipment (e.g., properly aerated
tanks and enriched environments). Methods of containment and euthanasia
are identical to acqautic invertebrates although we do not recommend
using them for invasive procedures, particularly in regions where they
fall under regulations on animals in research. There is likely to be a
significant regulatory and administrative burden for a community lab in
these areas. And in all cases, cephalopods require a significant
investment in care and husbandry.

**Major Safety Considerations**

-   Risk of disease infection and transmission.

-   Allergies.

**Euthanasia and Disposal**

Euthanasia and disposal recommendations are identical to aquatic
invertebrates. Check specific guidance from [[AVMA Guidelines for the
Euthanasia of Animals: 2013
Edition]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf)
or equivalent local guidelines.

More information on use of cephalopods in research can be found in
Fiorito, Graziano, et al., \"[[Guidelines for the Care and Welfare of
Cephalopods in Research--A consensus based on an initiative by CephRes,
FELASA and the Boyd
Group]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354955).\" Laboratory
animals 49.2_suppl (2015): 1-90.

### Fish and Amphibians

There are instances of projects using fish (e.g., *Danio rerio* or
zebrafish) and amphibians (e.g., *Xenopus laevis* or frogs). Notably, a
frog gene therapy kit is provided by one biology kit
[[company]{.ul}](https://phys.org/news/2019-01-gene-editing-kit-power-frog-growth.html)
in the U.S. Its use is acceptable under existing U.S. guidelines but
would not be possible in Europe outside of a lab that has met the
regulatory requirements for work with vertebrate animals. Always check
local legislation and regulation before embarking on any research
involving vertebrates. Fish, reptiles, and amphibians may also require
[[permits]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#)
to import and keep in captivity.

**Containment**

There are specific guidelines for the care and housing of fish and
amphibians, including housing, food, light, temperature, humidity, food,
and enrichment in the [[UK Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of
Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific
Purposes]{.ul}](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388535/CoPanimalsWeb.pdf)
and the [[Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals]{.ul}](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf)
published by the National Academies Press. In the U.S. guidelines for
fish can be found in [[American Fisheries
Society's]{.ul}](https://fisheries.org/policy-media/science-guidelines/guidelines-for-the-use-of-fishes-in-research/)
guidelines and [[Amphibians
guidelines]{.ul}](https://www.aaalac.org/accreditation/RefResources/SS_Amphib.pdf).
Always check that the set of guidelines being used meets the minimum
regulatory requirements in your labs local jurisdiction.

**Major Safety Considerations**

-   Risk of disease infection and transmission.

-   Allergies.

-   Bites and stings.

**Euthanasia and Disposal**

Check specific guidance from [[AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of
Animals: 2013
Edition]{.ul}](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf)
or equivalent local guidelines.

### Mammals

The use of any mammals, including mice and rats for experimental
procedures, is not recommended and not advised in community labs.
Running a facility that meets current ethical and regulatory
requirements is very expensive and a considerable commitment. If mammals
must be used, information on housing requirements, regulations, and
guidelines are referenced throughout this chapter and below. ABSA offers
[[this video training]{.ul}](https://absa.org/absl1vid/) for working
with animals at BSL-1 level.

**16. Plant Biosafety**
=======================

**Introduction**
----------------

Plant biology research is important for understanding agriculture, the
environment, nutrition, energy, forestry, and horticulture. Plant
physiology, biochemistry, and development is different from animals, and
the understanding of these processes have contributed to many important
scientific advances. The development of new technologies, in particular
in modern genetics, is offering new promise to the plant sciences and
the field is continuing to evolve.

Generally, plant research does not pose a risk to human health but can
pose a hazard to other plants and the environment. Research involving
plant diseases, plant pests, or genetically modified plants requires
containment from the natural environment and from agricultural crops and
markets. Any community lab working with transgenic plants should review
the [[A Practical Guide to Containment: Plant Biosafety in
Research]{.ul}](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/78423/ISBPracticalGuidePlantContain.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
for biosafety and containment requirements and recommendations.

Please note that this guide is for work in contained environments (i.e.,
greenhouses) and that individual countries may have different
requirements. Furthermore, work in a home or community lab may require
additional safety restrictions or further considerations during risk
assessments.

**Model Organisms**
-------------------

*Arabidopsis thaliana* is a very common plant model organism, but
improved genetic tools and technologies are expanding the number of
plant models being used. Tobacco, maize (*Zea mays*), Lotus japonicus
(legume), and rice (*Oryza sativa*) are also commonly used in the
research lab. This
[[article]{.ul}](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2816%2931082-0)
in *Cell* provides highlights of some of the new plants being studied.
Liverworts (*Marchantia polymorpha*) are being developed as a model
organism by both community and academic labs through the
[[OpenPlant]{.ul}](https://www.openplant.org/) Synthetic Biology
Research Centre. This project aims to develop new tools and methods for
plant synthetic biology and provide mechanisms for open sharing of
standardized resources. Plants are also used by artists and designers
who participate in community labs, so the materials in this chapter
apply to artistic uses of plants as well.

**Plant Tissue Culture and Sterile Technique**
----------------------------------------------

Experimenting with plants often involves growing plants in a controlled
environment, particularly where they have been genetically modified or
many copies are being generated. Plant tissue culture is a collection of
techniques that involves the use of plant cells, small pieces of plant
tissue (explants), or plant organs which are cultured in defined
nutrient medium under sterile conditions. Single cells, plant cells
without cell walls (protoplasts), pieces of leaves, stems, or roots can
often be used to generate a whole new plant on culture media given the
required nutrients and plant hormones.

Plant tissue culture is typically performed in a sterile environment. A
single fungal spore or bacterial cell that may come into contact with
plant growth media can rapidly reproduce and quickly take over the small
plant piece that is being grown. Therefore, it is important to use
[[aseptic
techniques]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.geo93pvtpsql).
The principles of aseptic technique are described in detail
[[here.]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.geo93pvtpsql)
A couple of aspects of aseptic technique that are unique to plants
include the following:

-   If working with plant material from the wild, the plant part to be
    > used must first be surface sterilized to remove any bacteria or
    > fungal spores present (methods may vary, depending on the plant
    > part, see [[Bhatia, S,
    > 2015]{.ul}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128022214000029)).
    > There is a balance between killing all microorganisms but not
    > causing any adverse damage to the plant material.

-   Wash the prepared plant material in a detergent-water mixture for
    > about 20 minutes. If using hairy plant material, scrub with a soft
    > brush (toothbrush). This will help remove fungi, and the detergent
    > will help wet the material and remove air bubbles that may be
    > trapped between tiny hairs on a plant.

-   Transfer the washed plant material to a sterilizing bleach solution
    > (1 part bleach to 9 parts water). Gently shake the mixture for 1
    > minute and then leave to soak for 10-20 minutes. Carefully pour
    > off the bleach solution using the lid to keep the plant tissue
    > from coming out, and then carefully cap the container.

-   At this point, the tissue is considered sterile. All subsequent
    > rinses should be done with sterile water, and all manipulations of
    > the tissue performed with sterile instruments and supplies.

-   The tools used are similar to those utilized in the [[culturing of
    > microorganisms]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#)
    > (including the use of Petri dishes, etc.) but also include things
    > like scalpel blades and forceps. Ensure that all of the tools used
    > for working with the plants are sterilized by autoclaving or oven
    > sterilization.

Identifying Contamination
-------------------------

Contamination in plant tissue culture is usually caused by the entry of
pathogens and other microbial contaminants into the culture, either from
the initial explants or by entry of environmental microorganisms and
microarthropods during the in vitro culture stages.

Contaminants are typically pathogenic or opportunistic colonizers of the
plant that escaped surface sterilization or were embedded in the
original material. Such contaminants may not be visible and may remain
latent, transmitting diseases and contamination through generations and
sometimes only emerging when the culture media changes. They may only be
discovered on inspection by microscopy, by use of PCR to detect pathogen
DNA, or through biochemical tests. When aseptic cultures are eventually
established, contamination can also occur from environmental and
human-associated microorganisms. This contamination can usually be seen
by visual inspection of the cultures.

Contamination is best managed by good aseptic working practices in the
lab.

Biological Risk Assessment for Plants
-------------------------------------

The criteria for conducting risk assessments and determining biosafety
levels for plant research are related to any hazards the plants
inherently pose to human or animal health and the environment and
whether they are transgenic.

Transgenic plants are plants that have been genetically engineered or
modified using recombinant or synthetic DNA to create plants with new
traits. For example, plants that are herbicide or insect resistance, or
express human or animal genes to produce medicinal or nutritional
products. Consideration of risk is similar to [[recombinant or synthetic
DNA
experiments]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/edit#heading=h.thymwn8lkdi2)
including:

-   **Source and nature of the introduced DNA**

    -   Exotic infectious agent or pathogenic organism

    -   Fragment of DNA or complete genome

    -   Function of the introduced DNA

-   **Recipient organism**

    -   Mode and ease of dissemination

    -   Invasiveness

    -   Noxious weed or capable of interbreeding with noxious weeds

    -   Potential for outcrossing between recipient organisms and
        > related species

    -   Potential for detrimental impact on natural or managed
        > ecosystems

-   **Nature of expressed protein**

    -   Vertebrate toxin or potential or known allergen

    -   Toxic to other organisms in the local environment

-   **Local environment**

    -   Nature and importance of nearby crops

    -   Presence of sexually compatible wild or weedy species

-   **Experimental procedures**

    -   Transport to or from greenhouse necessary containment measures

Biosafety Levels and Physical Containment
-----------------------------------------

In the U.S., USDA-APHIS regulates the importation, interstate movement,
and release into the environment of all GM and some non-GM plants. They
do not designate a biosafety level for plant research but instead
publish standard
[[guidelines]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/import-information/permits/regulated-organism-and-soil-permits/sa_containment/ct_containment_facility_inspections)
for containment, with suggested methods for achieving the standard.

Experiments with transgenic plants that do not present a risk to health
or the environment are exempt from oversight under the [[NIH Guidelines
for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid
Molecules]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/biotechnology/nih-guidelines/).
However, the USDA, EPA, or local regulators may make their own
determinations of experiments that are exempt from oversight and permits
may still be required (see [[Regulations and
Permits]{.ul}](#regulations-and-permits)). For example, import,
interstate movement, or release of *Agrobacterium* (a plant pathogen
commonly used in plant genetic modification experiments), requires a
permit from the USDA (see [[Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ)
526]{.ul})](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/import-information/permits/regulated-organism-and-soil-permits).

For research that does fall under the NIH Guideline, four biosafety
levels (referred to as BL1-P through BL4-P) are described in Appendix L:
"Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic
Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving Plants". These NIH biosafety
levels are generally accepted as the most relevant for plant work.

### Biosafety Level 1-P (BL1-P)

BL1-P is designed to provide a moderate level of containment for
experiments where there is convincing biological evidence that there is
low to no risk of survival, transfer, or dissemination of recombinant
DNA into the environment, or low to no risk to the environment in the
event of accidental release.

BL1-P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant or synthetic
DNA-containing plants and plant-associated microorganisms that are not
noxious weeds and are neither easily disseminated nor detrimental to the
environment. For example, BL1-P would be recommended for a plant
transformation using recombinant *Agrobacterium* where the genetic
modification is not expected to introduce adverse characteristics such
as pathogenicity or increasing allergic reactivity.

Requirements at BL-1P include:

-   Access to the lab (and/or greenhouse) is limited or restricted when
    > experiments are in progress.

-   Prior to entering the lab, personnel are required to read and follow
    > the instructions for BL-1P practices and procedures.

-   All procedures must be performed in accordance with accepted
    > greenhouse practices appropriate to the experimental organism.

-   Records must be kept of experiments in progress in a greenhouse
    > facility.

-   All experimental organisms must be rendered biologically inactive by
    > appropriate methods before disposal (see later section on
    > [[Disposal]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-2P1J2ojiO5a84cYenmJrjXihcmnnW3yj1b9n8Dsbw/edit#heading=h.u7e87btkrcts)).

-   A program must be implemented to control undesired species (e.g.,
    > weed, rodent, arthropod pests, pathogens) by methods appropriate
    > to the organisms and in accordance with applicable state and
    > federal laws.

-   House arthropods and other motile macroorganisms (e.g., flying
    > arthropods or nematodes) must be housed in appropriate cages. If
    > they are released within the greenhouse, precautions must be taken
    > to minimize escape.

-   The greenhouse floor may be composed of gravel or other porous
    > material, although impervious (e.g., concrete) walkways are
    > recommended.

-   Windows and other openings in the walls and roof of the lab and
    > greenhouse facility may be open for ventilation and do not require
    > any special barrier. However, screens are recommended to contain
    > or exclude pollen, microorganisms, or small flying animals (e.g.,
    > arthropods and birds).

-   Labs and greenhouses must be locked when unoccupied to secure
    > against accidental exposure, unauthorized use, and theft.

### Biosafety Level 2-P (BL2-P)

BL2-P is recommended for:

-   Transgenic plants that are noxious weeds (i.e., a weed which is
    > considered to be harmful to the environment or animals) or can
    > interbreed with noxious weeds.

-   Transgenic plants where the introduced DNA contains the complete
    > genome of an non-exotic (i.e., indigenous or native to the
    > country) infectious agent.

-   Transgenic plants or plant pathogens that may have a detrimental
    > impact to the environment.

BL2-P is designed to provide a greater level of containment in cases
where there is a recognized possibility of survival, transmission, or
dissemination of GM plants and the consequence of such an inadvertent
release has a predictably minimal biological impact. For containment
requirements, see [[Appendix L of the NIH
Guidelines]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.pdf).

### Biosafety Level 3-P and 4-P (BL3-P and BL4-P)

BL3-P and BL4-P describe additional containment conditions for research
with plants, pathogens, and other organisms that require special
containment because of their recognized potential for significant damage
to managed or natural ecosystems. We do not recommend community labs use
transgenic plants requiring BL3-P and BL4-P as the containment
requirements are significant (see [[Appendix L of the NIH
Guidelines]{.ul}](https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.pdf)).

Biological Containment for Plants
---------------------------------

Biological containment is defined as the use of biological means to
block plant sexual and vegetative reproduction and to prevent the spread
and persistence of genetic material in the environment and is
recommended for any work with GM plants. Some examples of biological
containment include:

-   **Adding a "killswitch" when working with GMOs for research
    > purposes**

    -   Making the plants dependent on something in the media for
        > survival

    -   Disrupting photosynthesis so they cannot produce their own
        > energy

-   **Controlling seed dispersal or sporulation**

    -   Using female-only clonal cultures

    -   Avoiding any mating experiments

    -   Knocking out any sporulation pathways

-   **Chloroplast engineering**

    -   Restricting the transgene to the chloroplast genome which
        > prevents outcrossing

Disposal 
--------

Plants without seeds can initially be inactivated by withholding water
until the plant is fully desiccated prior to disposal. If plants with
seeds are used, then the seeds should be collected for inactivation
before removal from the lab along with all plants, plant parts,
containers, potting media and soil containing recombinant or synthetic
nucleic acids or that contain plant pathogens.

Inactivation is generally accomplished using a steam autoclave, dry
oven, or incineration (see [[Waste
Disposal]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15i2FY854VOLAVObpuDf7FAnac5oSxGCR)
for more information on disposing of biological waste). An autoclave is
likely to be the most convenient method for community labs. In some
countries, including
[[Australia]{.ul}](http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/Content/transport-guide-1),
there are specific regulations for autoclaving plant waste, and if an
autoclave is used to decontaminate, it must be spore-tested for
efficiency every month. If an autoclave is not available, plant material
may be inactivated by heating to 85-100ºC for 30 minutes in a box made
of heat-resistant materials using electric heating coils (known as soil
sterilizers in the greenhouse industry). sUSDA-APHIS guidelines suggest
treating soil and other solid wastes at a minimum of 104 ºC for 3 hours
before disposal when working with fungal, viral, or nematode plant
pathogens under permit.

If *Agrobacterium* cultures are used, they should be treated with 1 part
bleach to 9 parts of culture (10% final concentration) for a minimum of
20 minutes prior to disposal.

Regulations and Permits
-----------------------

The regulations related to plant use in research have an emphasis on the
protection of the environment and on agriculture and less on the impact
to the investigator.

Country Guidelines 
------------------

### United States 

In the U.S., plant research is overseen by multiple agencies.

**USDA.** At the federal level, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA-APHIS) regulates
plant pests, plants, and plant products, and the movement, importation,
and field release of genetically engineered plants and arthropods.
Regulations and guidance for the importation, interstate movement, and
release into the environment of genetically engineered organisms are
implemented by the [[Biotechnology Regulatory
Services]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/biotechnology).
Fieldwork with genetically engineered plants requires permits from APHIS
before work can begin.

If receiving, sharing, or ordering plants from institutions in different
states or countries, or if working with any plant pests or pathogens, a
[[permit]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/permits) may
be required prior to shipment.

**Types of USDA-APHIS Permits (often relevant to community labs):**

-   [[Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ)
    > 526]{.ul}](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/import-information/permits/regulated-organism-and-soil-permits/ct_plantpest).
    > This permit is required for the importation, interstate movement,
    > and environmental release of plant pests (e.g., plant feeding
    > insects, mites, snails, slugs, and plant pathogenic bacteria,
    > viruses, fungi), biological control organisms of plant pests and
    > weeds, bees, parasitic plants, and federally listed noxious weeds.
    > Note: If work is planned involving import, interstate-transport,
    > or release of *Agrobacterium* (a plant pathogen commonly used in

Cannabis or Other Controlled Substances 
---------------------------------------

As cannabis becomes legal in more places, there has been an increase in
the number of research projects involving this plant, as well as startup
companies interested in isolating particular compounds for various uses.
Some states and countries, in which it is legal, still require permits
or registrations to work with cannabis. Be sure to investigate local
country/state laws before using cannabis in the lab. In the U.S. at the
federal level, it remains illegal, and is classified as a [[Schedule
I]{.ul}](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/812.htm) drug
(Schedule I and II substances are the most stringently regulated).

The use of cannabis and other controlled substances in research must
comply with local, state, and federal laws. In the U.S., many state
health departments require licences, and the federal Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA) requires registrations. In addition to licenses and
registration, there are typically storage, security, use, disposal, and
inventorying requirements.

Read more about the U.S. federal regulations

and
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/index.html).
Individuals and community labs should check with their country and state
laws before conducting any work with cannabis or controlled substances.

**17. Biosecurity in Community Labs**
=====================================

This section discusses management practices to improve biological
security, or biosecurity, in community labs. The [[CEN Workshop
Agreement 15793]{.ul}](https://www.uab.cat/doc/CWA15793_2011) defines
biosecurity as "the protection, control and accountability of biological
agents and toxins" and is designed to "prevent their loss, theft,
misuse, diversion of, unauthorized access, or intentional unauthorized
release."

The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) International, defines
biosecurity as "the risk-and threat-based control measures established
to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, loss, theft, diversion and
intentional release of valuable biological materials, pathogens, toxins,
information, expertise, equipment, technology and intellectual property
that have the potential to cause harm to humans, animals, plants, the
environment, public safety or national security."

Because community labs are designed to be open and collaborative, have
valuable equipment and sometimes have hazardous materials, they may be
vulnerable to individuals who may misuse the space, steal, or compromise
valuable equipment, supplies, and information. Every community lab
should consider implementing procedures that minimize the risks
associated with someone entering the space for this purpose. At the same
time, the openness and visibility that community labs offer provides
protection against these types of nefarious actors (e.g., if everyone
can see what you're doing, it\'s difficult to do something nefarious
without someone noticing and stopping them).

Creating a Safety and Security Policy
-------------------------------------

Community labs are encouraged to create a Safety and Security plan with
members working in the community lab to discuss appropriate
methodologies for protecting valuable biological materials (including
pathogens and toxins), equipment, expertise, and intellectual property.
Many community labs already have safety contacts, but we recommend
considering adding security as part of their mandates, or designating
another point of contact.

A good first step to improving biosecurity is to implement modifications
to practices that don't change ease and accessibility but mitigate
potential risks. To some degree, these include small changes to lab
procedures. On a larger level they include membership education and
promoting awareness and understanding.

We recommend drafting a Safety and Security plan that includes policies
about signage, labels, training, supervision, work hours, and codes of
conduct. Examples of such plans can be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.uvic.ca/ohse/assets/docs/biosecurityplan.pdf)
and
[[here]{.ul}](https://www.labmanager.com/lab-health-and-safety/2011/11/the-4-key-parts-of-a-biosecurity-plan#.Xc1z0S2ZPOQ).

Information about the safety contact or team and their responsibilities
should be shared broadly within the organization. Biological security
responsibilities include the following, which may overlap with other
responsibilities such as emergency planning, lab management, and members
training:

-   Maintain knowledge of applicable [[biosecurity rules, standards,
    > regulations, and
    > guidelines]{.ul}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661789/).

-   Understand and communicate membership vetting procedures.

-   Consider biosecurity risks in the risk assessment.

-   Recommend strategies for the detection of thefts, losses, and
    > containment breaches of lab materials (e.g., observing spilled
    > containers, Petri dishes in improper places, lab materials in
    > trash receptacles).

-   Include security elements in safety induction training such as how
    > to identify and remove unauthorized individuals from the lab
    > (e.g., contacting police or security services).

-   Develop training elements that address how to protect valuable
    > biological material and sensitive information (e.g., good data
    > management practices, information accountability, computer, and
    > network security).

-   Ensure a system is in place to account for all biological/chemical
    > materials and related information in the facility (e.g.,
    > biological, chemical, and equipment inventories).

-   Prepare for possible emergencies (e.g., fires, earthquakes,
    > flooding, building damage, gas leaks, power outage) and perform
    > drills to test emergency response procedures.

-   Plan ahead on how to handle news media inquiries.

-   Create a strategic protocol if a suspicious package arrives at the
    > community lab.

-   Establish good relationships and ask for help with training from
    > local fire, police, emergency response, and public health
    > institutions.

-   Evaluate the lab's safety and security plan regularly to make
    > recommendations for improvement.

Biological Inventory
--------------------

Biological inventories are needed in community labs to effectively
assess the risks of the materials being used. Most community labs should
have a [[risk
assessment]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/edit)
process in place for biological materials coming into the lab, which
usually occurs at the start of a project and is periodically reviewed.
Having an on-going biological inventory helps with this process and
gives individuals beyond the lab management the opportunity to view what
is being used. Inventories are also beneficial to keep track of
materials as most community labs encourage the sharing of resources.

Community labs should consider an inventory system for all biological
organisms and molecules (including synthetic nucleic acids and
plasmids), diagnostic specimens, human and animal blood and sera, and
other potentially hazardous biological materials (if they exist in the
lab). Examples of items to record in a biological inventory should
include:

-   Name of material (e.g., the genus and species)

-   Date of addition, as well as expiration date (if applicable)

-   Type of container (e.g., a Petri dish, conical tube, lyophilized
    > sample)

-   Location information (e.g., building name, room number, freezer
    > number, location in freezer)

-   Name of responsible party and contact information for emergencies

Inventories should be maintained for freezers, refrigerators, dewars,
and other containers used to store biological materials. The community
labs should also consider implementing a regular inventory sweep or spot
check system to verify that all materials are present and accounted for,
and dispose of anything past its expiration date.

A copy of the biological inventory should ideally be provided to local
public health departments and emergency response teams on a frequent,
regular basis (if appropriate for the jurisdiction). Importantly, the
inventory should be available in the event of an emergency in both
digital and paper form.

Chemical Inventories
--------------------

An inventory of chemicals, along with [[safety data
sheets]{.ul}](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html) and other
information about the chemicals being used, is vital to ensure
compliance with federal, state, and municipal regulations (see [[Chapter
10 - Chemical
Safety]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit)).
Community lab volunteers and members cannot adequately prepare for fires
or emergencies without this information, so it protects them and the
surrounding community. A well-managed inventory system also promotes
sustainable operations, such as an economical use of chemicals (i.e.,
the time and expense of procuring new chemicals may be avoided if it is
already in the inventory), and promotes shared resources. Responsibility
for chemical safety may be a specific role or assigned to an existing
member of the lab's Safety Team.

The key elements of any chemical inventory should include the following
items:

-   Name of chemical

-   Molecular formula

-   Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number (CAS \#)

-   Fire rating for the chemical

-   Source of the chemicals

-   Volume of the container

-   Quantity of chemicals

-   Date of acquisition and/or expiration date (to ensure that unstable
    > chemicals are not stored beyond expiration)

-   Any safety-related documentation for the chemical (link to the SDS
    > for digital inventories) [[Click
    > here]{.ul}](https://www.msdsonline.com/sds-search/) for a link to
    > many SDS sheets.

-   Location information (e.g., building name, room number, cabinet,
    > shelf)

-   Name of responsible party and contact information for emergencies

The ability to monitor the inventory is equally important. This would
ideally be accomplished by the use of a chemical inventory log to track
when a chemical is used or leaves the lab for any reason along with an
annual stock-taking. Key elements of a log would include:

-   Date and name of person adding chemical to inventory

-   Name of person removing the chemical from inventory

-   Name of chemical being removed from inventory

-   Date chemical removed from inventory

-   Amount used (if applicable)

-   Name of person returning the chemical to the inventory

-   Date chemical returned to inventory

A copy of the [[chemical
inventory]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tp3xQsqfTVTN-jGD9aiUQBdoXZcmTmOIXGWwwO8E5Fo/edit?usp=sharing)
should be provided to local fire departments and emergency response
teams on a frequent, regular basis if this is appropriate in your
context. Importantly, the inventory should be available in the event of
an emergency in both digital and paper form (see
[[example]{.ul}](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/ehs/documents/ls-chemical-inventory-template.xls)).

Equipment Inventory
-------------------

The equipment and devices used in community labs are often costly and
difficult to obtain, yet essential for successful community and member
projects as well as workshops and other learning opportunities.

Having an accurate list of equipment and devices in the space is helpful
in the event of theft or damage, including from fire or other
catastrophic events. Law enforcement and insurance companies may request
the inventory to prove that the device or equipment originated from the
community lab. Implementing a log to record usage may also be useful for
scheduling maintenance and repairs.

Pieces of equipment and devices used in the community lab may be used to
cause harm. For example, centrifuges, fermenters, incubators, and other
devices could be used to create illegal or illicit products, such as
drugs or explosive devices. Other equipment, such as laptops and
microscope lenses are prone to theft because they can be easily pocketed
and resold. Be aware that this is a possibility and monitor this
equipment carefully. If there is any suspicion of theft or misuse, labs
may wish to install video monitoring for critical equipment, install
anti-theft cables or access locks, or move the equipment and devices to
a less visible or locked location.

Managing an accurate list of the equipment and devices, along with their
serial numbers, in the facility will allow for better security and
reduce the risk of a possible nefarious act. While there is a hope that
everyone entering the community labs is altruistic and good natured,
there may also be individuals with other intentions.

Vetting New Members and Guests
------------------------------

A community lab works because of the unity and purpose of community
members. While projects should be vetted for chemicals, methods,
organisms, and ethics, it is important to also vet the individuals,
groups, and guests of the lab. Because of the close-knit nature of a
community lab, one bad apple can ruin the collaborative nature of the
space.

Labs should consider implementing a process to evaluate individuals
wishing to gain access to the facility. This may be accomplished through
an application form, which outlines the roles and responsibilities of
everyone using the facility, codes of conduct, and terms and conditions
of lab membership. Assessments---including interviews and reference
checks---may be used to decide whether an individual would make a
suitable member of the lab.

Here is a list of methods others have used to vet members of their
community lab:

-   Invite them to open houses, classes, social events, or meetings and
    > see how they interact.

-   Observe how individuals respond to requests for cleanup, adhere to
    > safety policies, and treat shared equipment.

-   Ask them to do group tasks to see how they interact with others.

-   Ask about their ongoing progress and challenges to get to know them
    > better.

-   Create a trial period during which the new member has more
    > restricted access to the lab and existing members can block their
    > membership.

-   Require current members to vouch for a new member.

-   Look at a person\'s social media and public reputation to determine
    > intent and character for approval (usually only done when there's
    > a reason to suspect an issue with a prospective member).

-   If the member is working with kids, or protected individuals, you
    > may also be required by law or insurance to pay for a professional
    > background check.

In addition, procedures to remove an individual from the premises and
the organization should be established and be clearly communicated to
individuals using the facility. Everyone in the community lab must be
expected to conduct experiments in a safe and ethical manner, and follow
all federal, state, and local laws.

We recommend monitoring individuals who exhibit unusual behavior, make
other members feel uncomfortable, are closed or become secretive when
you approach them about their work, or are aggressive or combative with
others during interactions.

Vetting is an ongoing process even after members have joined and there
may be issues that arise that may cause a lab to deny membership or ban
a current member. Individuals working in a community lab should report
significant changes in behavior, attitudes, demeanor, or actions (e.g.,
increasingly withdrawn, significant, and prolonged deterioration in
appearance, unjustified anger or aggression, signs of alcohol/drug
abuse, criminal activity, and unexplained absences) to the lab
management or the Safety and Security Team.

Other scenarios that should be reported to the Safety and Security Team
include:

-   Stated or implied threats, whether written or verbal, to individuals
    > or the organization.

-   Any circumstances that appear suspicious, such as activities that do
    > not correspond to stated official project goals, requests for
    > security or facility information without justification, acts of
    > vandalism or property damage, and attempts to gain unauthorized
    > access for friends or colleagues.

-   Unlawfully carrying weapons or carrying weapons in violation of
    > facility policies.

-   Bringing in, growing, or synthesizing unapproved or illegal
    > substances.

-   Providing false information on applications or other formal
    > institutional documents.

-   Unauthorized work performed by an individual(s) in a facility during
    > off-hours.

Code of conduct agreements, membership agreements, waivers, and other
documents should set standards for behavior and dismissal. It is
important to have open lines of communication with new members so that
should an issue arise, there are no surprises regarding disciplinary
action.

| **Real-world Experiences with Problem Members**                      |
|                                                                      |
| "We had a member in the lab who was an outspoken advocate for        |
| community science, and who seemed to mesh well with the community    |
| members. However, we were alarmed that social media portrayed this   |
| individual in a different light. Very aggressive posts, attacks on   |
| communities, science validity, discouraging, profanity-laced         |
| comments, quickly informed us it violated our code of conduct and    |
| membership agreement, and that we did not want this person as part   |
| of our community. We informed a network of labs of our findings and  |
| now have a reciprocal permanent ban on this member in the community. |
| "                                                                    |
|                                                                      |
| "We refused one new member, because he made several of the women in  |
| the space feel uncomfortable. There was no single instance of        |
| behavior that would have gotten an existing member banned from the   |
| space, but since he was still in his trial period, it was easy       |
| enough to say, 'I'm sorry, but we don't think you would be a good    |
| fit for our community'."                                             |
|                                                                      |
| "One guest attended many networking events with the community over a |
| month. This member, like many, wanted more skills and knowledge from |
| more advanced scientists. At first, they were shy and soft spoken.   |
| Then they began aggressively asking and cornering people to teach    |
| them. This progressed into visiting at times when the lab was closed |
| to the public and blasting staff with profanity when they were asked |
| to leave. Later we learned about them calling their drug dealer from |
| a staff member's phone."                                             |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Resolving Conflict
------------------

When dealing with problematic members, it is best to attempt to
[[resolve
conflict]{.ul}](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/provide-information-enhance-skills/conflict-resolution/main)
early or as soon as possible before the problem exacerbates.
Investigate, be curious, ask questions, try to understand what the
member's intentions are. It's sometimes possible that a member is not
self-aware enough to know that they are causing problems.

Invite the member to meet with the lab manager or leadership, and
explain clearly what the issues are. Make sure to be specific about the
changes that need to be made. If feasible, offer the member an
opportunity to improve their behavior in the lab, and conduct frequent
check-ins and closely monitor their activities.

If there are problems between members, be sure to bring the members
together to discuss the problems openly. Don't take sides, but rather
get the members to hear and understand each other and come to an
agreement together on how to resolve the problem. In severe cases, there
may be professional mediation services you can call upon within your
community.

-   [[Training for Conflict
    > Resolution]{.ul}](https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/provide-information-enhance-skills/conflict-resolution/main)

-   [[Conflict Mediation
    > Guidelines]{.ul}](https://web.stanford.edu/group/resed/resed/staffresources/RM/training/conflict.html)

**Removing Members / Banned List**
----------------------------------

Removing members is often a very difficult but sometimes a necessary
part of running a community organization. It is important to set
standards for conduct and also demonstrate to the community that
leadership is willing to hold members to account for their conduct
inside as well as outside of the lab. It is important to set up and
understand the process of removing and banning a member. These
procedures should be documented in your Code of Conduct, Membership
Agreement, and possibly other places like your waiver and bylaws
depending on your legal structure. Removal could include immediate
dismissal during a class, imposing a temporary cool-off period, or a
permanent ban from the community lab. These policies should be
documented in your code of conduct and adhered to.

One recommendation that should be strongly enforced is to document these
cases from many points of view in an incident report form. These
documents may be legally required (e.g., by corporate structure) or be
involved in legal proceedings. Lab leadership should seek to resolve
these issues thoroughly and quickly.

It is also recommended that labs share banned members lists with other
community labs and makerspaces, especially in communities where
traveling to other labs or makerspaces is possible. Please be aware that
there are privacy issues with listing people's names publicly. Listing
of banned individuals should not be shared with the greater public.

Lab Access, Keys, and Fobs
--------------------------

While community labs should be welcoming places, they also require
limits to access for the safety and security of staff and members,
equipment, materials, and space. Although access policies differ across
labs, we recommend these general rules about restricting access to the
lab:

-   Keys and codes should only be provided to people who have been
    > assessed and approved by lab management.

-   We recommend using keycards or key fobs that allow lab management to
    > track lab entry. This is useful in the case of emergencies,
    > thefts, unauthorized entries, or accidents.

-   Be sure to keep a log of keys signed in and out.

-   If an assigned key is lost, or not returned by an old member, be
    > sure to have the key card or fob deactivated.

-   Consider using locks and keys to restrict containers of hazardous
    > chemicals, organisms, or higher containment facilities (e.g.,
    > BSL-2) to only those who have approved access.

-   Establish clear guest lab access policies. Because guests are often
    > unvetted, some labs restrict guest visits to staff working hours.
    > Others have clear policies of restricting unaccompanied guests.

-   Consider having a sign-in/sign-out policy for guests.

-   Establish clear policies about who may enter the lab after work
    > hours. Some labs allow members 24-hour access. Some selectively
    > allow 24-hour access for specific people or activities, while
    > others allow access during designated working hours only. Each
    > policy comes with tradeoffs and should be discussed with
    > membership before being implemented.

Protecting User Information and Intellectual Property 
-----------------------------------------------------

The data collected about members often includes personal information,
like emergency contacts, health information, or other information that
might be sensitive and members might not want openly shared. If you have
this information on paper forms be sure to store the forms in cabinets
that can be locked. Or if you store the information electronically, make
sure the files are password protected and only accessible to authorized
personnel.

Intellectual Property
---------------------

Some lab members might be working on projects that they intend to patent
or keep as private intellectual property. Most community labs choose not
to claim any ownership of intellectual property (IP) and expect that the
same openness is reciprocated.

All members should be able to provide enough information about their
projects to the lab's Safety Team to conduct a safety assessment.
Because they are working in a community lab where open sharing is part
of the culture, the members should be informed that they are responsible
for protecting their own IP if needed.

18. Outreach
============

Taking Your Science Outside the Lab
-----------------------------------

Taking your science outside of the carefully controlled laboratory
environment offers some wonderful opportunities to bring it to a wider
audience, but it can also pose its own unique biosafety challenges.

Make sure to review [[Acquiring, Shipping, and Transporting
Materials]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit)
for any issues regarding transporting materials to and from the venue.
If you do take genetically engineered strains somewhere, make sure to
take precautions against spillage (you may want to take a spill kit with
you, including enough bleach or other disinfectant to kill any organisms
that did spill), and never let anyone else take any of the organisms
home. Giving any genetically engineered organism to someone who does not
have a lab to handle it properly could be considered an unauthorized
environmental release. Some labs have used waiver forms to allow
participants to take materials home with them, where the participant
assumes all responsibility for proper disposal (e.g., submerging in
bleach), but it is unclear what legal weights such a waiver has if you
know that the recipient will be taking it somewhere other than an actual
lab.

Always make sure the venue owner knows what you intend to do, and what
you intend to bring, and be respectful of any restrictions or special
precautions they may require. For example, a venue might prohibit you
from bringing any genetically engineered organisms, or may require you
to cover all surfaces with plastic. Some art museums may impose a
lengthy approval process to bring any biological materials on-site
because they may have fragile and valuable collections to protect.

Here are some venues that you might encounter, and specific biosafety
challenges they may pose:

Maker Faire or Other Indoor Fair
--------------------------------

Large public events---especially with young children present under
various degrees of supervision---may require some forethought to keep
your science safe. Even if you do not bring any live cultures, glassware
and other equipment can break and hurt people. Are you prepared to deal
with a situation where a 2 year old in a stroller grabs something from
your table and puts it in their mouth while you're having a conversation
with their parents? Or when a rambunctious 5 year old pulls on the table
cloth covering your booth and causes some of your science to come
crashing down? We recommend that you secure tablecloths by tying them to
the table legs or by taping or clamping them to the table. Also make
sure that any cultures, fragile pieces of equipment, or glassware are
out of reach of small fingers.

If you do bring live cultures or genetically engineered organisms to a
public event like this, make sure they are properly contained to avoid
any exposure and always under direct control of someone from your lab
who is trained to work with them. Don't leave Petri plates lying around
on your booth or else someone may walk off with them.

Street Fair or Other Open Air Fair
----------------------------------

Open air venues are subject to the same challenges as indoor fairs, plus
weather! You may want to protect booth staff and any biological
materials by investing in a collapsible 10'x10' canopy tent. Plan for
inclement weather, such as high wind and rain. Sudden wind gusts can
lift up your canopy or even cause another exhibitor's canopy to crash
into yours. So make sure your canopy is weighted or tied down securely,
bring paper weights for any flyers or signs on your table, and limit the
amount of breakable glassware or spillable biological cultures you may
have on display.

Library or Classroom
--------------------

Regulation and insurance issues can make it difficult to work with kids
at your community lab. So why not go somewhere that is already set up to
deal with kids such as your local library or schools?

Make sure the materials you are presenting are age appropriate and
vetted extra carefully for biosafety. Keep in mind that you will be
working with children who may not yet have fully developed immune
systems (and/or highly litigious parents!), and keep that into account
for your Risk Assessment. For example, you may want to avoid working
with organisms that are technically considered Risk Group 1 but can pose
some health risks, such as *Serratia marcescens*. Depending on the age
of the children, you may also need to avoid using sharp scissors or
scalpels, etc.

Do not collect any information from the kids (including emails and
photographs) without explicit consent from their parents or guardian.
The school or library should be able to tell you what their rules are
around such things and may be able to assist you in contacting the kids
after the event (e.g., to send them some pictures of the agar art they
made).

Non-bio Makerspace
------------------

Adults with preconceived notions of acceptable risk and safety levels
can sometimes be harder to handle than kids that have no such notions.
If you go to do a hands-on science demo in a space that has very
different expectations around safety, be aware that some of the
"regulars" there may disregard or ridicule your safety instructions.
Familiarize yourself with the space and its safety culture in advance
and adjust your presentation accordingly, either by paying more
attention to the safety instructions or by omitting demonstrations that
you expect cannot be done safely in such an environment. Make sure you
have one of the managers of the other makerspace there and that they are
willing to back you up on safety issues if necessary.

Bar / Social Event (e.g., Nerdnite, Pint of Science)
----------------------------------------------------

Doing an interesting science event at a bar or similar venue is all
about managing expectations. You may be able to rope off part of the
space to do a hands-on demo under more controllable conditions. Or
perhaps stick to an activity involving nothing but safe household
ingredients, such as the Extracting DNA from Spit demo listed below.

Be prepared to have to deal with people who are inebriated and/or have
completely no interest or understanding of what you are doing. And yes,
if you bring a fluorescent yeast culture, someone will try to drink it.

Science Museum
--------------

Science museums can be a joy to work with because they typically already
have a good understanding of the safety and waste disposal issues you
will have to deal with. Get to know your local science museum. They are
a great way to get the word out about what you are doing, and they
typically welcome anything that will expose their patrons to a wider
range of topics and experiences.

Art Museum
----------

One of the top priorities for any art museum will be to protect the
valuable collections they house. Unless they have dealt with Bio Art
before and worked out some streamlined protocols, expect to have to work
through documentation and some questions from the conservation team. Art
museums may require sterilization of all materials or building special
enclosures to avoid any cross-contamination (or just to avoid upsetting
the careful humidity control in their exhibit space).

| **Example Outreach Activity: Agar Art**                              |
|                                                                      |
| An Agar Art workshop can provide for a simple, artistic introduction |
| to microbiology and genetically engineered bacteria for kids or      |
| adults alike. Count on a minimum of 2 hours, with a substantial      |
| amount of prep and follow-up time. Consider doing a series of        |
| workshops, so participants get a chance to improve their skills in   |
| this novel medium. Here is how Counter Culture Labs does this demo,  |
| with special focus on the biosafety aspects.                         |
|                                                                      |
| **Venue**                                                            |
|                                                                      |
| Make sure the venue owners know what you will be working with,       |
| including any genetically engineered organisms. Visit the site in    |
| advance and check what table and floor surfaces you will be working  |
| on. Be prepared to cover any porous table or floor surfaces with     |
| plastic sheeting if necessary (or whenever the venue owner wishes    |
| to). Make sure your demo area is close to a restroom or handwashing  |
| sink for participants to use.                                        |
|                                                                      |
| **Prepare in advance**                                               |
|                                                                      |
| 2-6 pigmented bacterial cultures to work with. For beginners, we     |
| recommend using a set of fluorescent or chromogenic *E. coli*        |
| strains that can all be grown with the same growth medium and        |
| antibiotic. We typically work with liquid cultures and fine paint    |
| brushes. For best result, prepare liquid cultures with the           |
| appropriate antibiotic overnight or no more than a day and a half in |
| advance. Others have had good results using plate cultures, and      |
| using inoculation loops or autoclaved toothpicks or skewers. Also    |
| prepare with appropriate growth medium and antibiotics. Using 2%     |
| agar makes the surface a bit easier to work with than the standard   |
| 1.5% agar plates. Let plates dry out a bit after pouring, and store  |
| at room temperature to avoid condensation.                           |
|                                                                      |

| 1.  Show examples of agar art for inspiration. You could do a half   |
|     > hour slideshow, or skip this step altogether to avoid          |
|     > contaminating people's creativity.                             |
|                                                                      |
| 2.  Notify participants in advance that they will NOT be able to     |
|     > take any plates with genetically engineered cultures home with |
|     > them.                                                          |
|                                                                      |
| 3.  Explain that making agar art is a bit like painting with         |
|     > invisible ink, so we will be creating a design on paper first, |
|     > placing it underneath the Petri plate, and then tracing over   |
|     > the design with the bacterial culture.                         |
|                                                                      |
| 4.  Hand out sheets of paper and tell participants to draw circles   |
|     > using a blank Petri plate as template (a letter-sized sheet    |
|     > fits 6 standard Petri plate-sized circles).                    |
|                                                                      |
| 5.  Provide markers in the same colors as the bacterial cultures the |
|     > participants will be working with, and ask them to draw their  |
|     > design on paper first.                                         |
|                                                                      |
| 6.  While they are working, you can come by with premade plates      |
|     > showing each of the bacterial cultures after they've developed |
|     > into colonies on agar. Wear gloves while holding the plates,   |
|     > and do not let participants touch them without gloves.         |
|                                                                      |
| 7.  After everybody is finished with their designs, remove all the   |
|     > markers, excess paper and any food, drink, or personal         |
|     > possessions from the table. Only their paper designs should be |
|     > left. Participants may want to take a picture of their paper   |
|     > designs at this point because they will not be able to take    |
|     > them with them.                                                |
|                                                                      |
| 8.  Have everybody put on gloves, and explain that they will be      |
|     > working with live bacterial cultures so no personal effects on |
|     > the table, no eating or drinking, no touching their face,      |
|     > clothing, phone or anything else with gloves on. If they need  |
|     > to leave the table for any reason, have them remove gloves and |
|     > wash hands (or wipe down hands with wet wipes) immediately.    |
|                                                                      |
| 9.  Carefully pour about ¼ inch / ½ cm bacterial culture in each of  |
|     > the color-coded jars, and provide each group of 4-8            |
|     > participants with a set of jars with each culture. Place 10-20 |
|     > correspondingly color-coded paint brushes in each jar. Each    |
|     > group also gets a larger waste jar for used brushes, filled    |
|     > with about an inch of isopropanol.                             |
|                                                                      |
| 10. Explain there should be no double dipping to avoid               |
|     > cross-contamination between the different colored cultures.    |
|                                                                      |
| 11. Provide each participant with one or two prepoured Petri plates. |
|     > Have them place the plate over their paper design, so they can |
|     > trace over it. You can stick the plate in place with           |
|     > double-sided tape, or put a mark on the side of the plate and  |
|     > on the paper to keep things aligned properly.                  |
|                                                                      |
| 12. Tell them to leave the plate closed whenever possible and to not |
|     > talk/cough/sneeze while the plate is open to avoid             |
|     > contamination. Since they are not working in a sterile field,  |
|     > some contamination may be expected                             |
|                                                                      |
| 13. If participants are running out of fresh brushes, occasionally   |
|     > collect isopropanol-soaked, used brushes from the waste jars   |
|     > and put them into a separate jar. Clean brushes (including     |
|     > handles) with soap and water, then rinse extensively with tap  |
|     > water, dry them off with paper towels, and redistribute        |
|     > cleaned brushes back into the correspondingly color-coded      |
|     > culture jars.                                                  |
|                                                                      |
| 14. Have participants label their plates with their name, email, and |
|     > date on the lid of the plate. Do not label on the bottom of    |
|     > the plate because that will show up in any pictures of the     |
|     > agar art, and they may not want to share their email with the  |
|     > whole world. If you are concerned about opening plates with    |
|     > some contamination, you could ask them to write on the side of |
|     > the lid instead, but be aware that some writing on the side    |
|     > may be legible in photos, depending on camera angle.           |
|                                                                      |
| 15. Show participants how to parafilm their plates. Make sure        |
|     > parafilm strips are cut thin enough to not obscure the         |
|     > artwork, but wide enough to form a good seal.                  |
|                                                                      |
| 16. Collect all parafilmed plates and take them back to your lab for |
|     > incubation. Clean all brushes as described above. Pour any     |
|     > leftover bacterial culture back into closeable bottles. Rinse  |
|     > out jars with isopropanol. If you used plastic sheeting, you   |
|     > can spray it wet with isopropanol or quaternary ammonium       |
|     > disinfectant and roll it up wet for maximum contact time. Put  |
|     > all potentially contaminated materials---plates, jars, cleaned |
|     > brushes, rolled up plastic sheeting, trash bag with used       |
|     > gloves, paper sheets with the original designs---in a plastic  |
|     > box and take them back to your lab for further cleaning or     |
|     > disposal, unless the venue owner has given explicit permission |
|     > to dispose of some items there.                                |
|                                                                      |
| 17. Thoroughly clean all surfaces with an appropriate surface        |
|     > disinfectant (e.g., quaternary ammonium spray). Make sure to   |
|     > test for material compatibility (e.g., isopropanol can stain   |
|     > vinyl or wood finishes), and allow sufficient contact time for |

| **Displaying your Agar Art**                                         |
|                                                                      |
| The agar plates will take a few days to develop and will be "at      |
| their prime" for a few days after. Beyond that, you will lose        |
| resolution due to the colonies outgrowing the original design. You   |
| may also start getting more contaminants growing on the plates. And  |
| if you wait long enough, the plates will start drying out and the    |
| colors will fade. We found that a good way to display the plates     |
| themselves while they are in the time window that they are worth     |
| looking at is by sandwiching them in between two plates of acrylic,  |
| held together with larger binder clips. A 17 inch (43cm) square      |
| display will fit 4x4 standard Petri plates. Carefully parafilm the   |
| Petri plates so they will not leak, and make sure there is a wide    |
| enough border around the plates to prevent fingers from reaching the |
| plates from the sides.                                               |
|                                                                      |
| However, the absolutely best way to display your Agar Art is by      |
| taking some high-resolution images while the plates are at their     |
| peak, and get some high-quality prints to hang on your walls.        |

| **Example Outreach Activity: Extracting DNA from Spit**              |
|                                                                      |
| DNA extraction from spit is an easy 5 minute science demo that is    |
| perfect for a science fair. Here is how Counter Culture Labs does    |
| this demo, with special focus on the biosafety aspects.              |
|                                                                      |
| **Supplies to bring**                                                |
|                                                                      |
| -   Small squeeze bottle of dish washing soap (e.g., Dawn, but       |
|     > pretty much any liquid soap will work)                         |
|                                                                      |
| -   Table salt---in a salt shaker with all but one large hole taped  |
|     > off                                                            |
|                                                                      |
| -   Isopropanol alcohol---in gooseneck or condiment squeeze bottle   |
|                                                                      |
| -   Optional: meat tenderizer powder                                 |
|                                                                      |
| -   Optional: toothpicks                                             |
|                                                                      |
| -   Gloves, paper towels, wet wipes, waterproof trash bag/container  |
|                                                                      |
| Note that the person running this demo should never be touching the  |
| tubes in which the participants are collecting their saliva. But     |
| just to be sure, wear gloves anyway. Participants don't need gloves  |
| because they will only be working with their own saliva. Disinfect   |
| hands/gloves with isopropanol or wet wipes as soon as possible if    |
| you do touch any of the saliva, to avoid cross-contaminating the bag |
| of sampling tubes, for example.                                      |
|                                                                      |
| 1.  Gather a group of participants from the people walking by your   |
|     > booth. If things are slow, it might help to shout "*Who wants  |
|     > to see their DNA? Start spitting into this tube*!".            |
|                                                                      |
| 2.  Hand out one sampling tube to each participant. We usually use a |
|     > bag of 5 ml polypropylene culture tubes: cheap, disposable and |
|     > unlikely to break. Ask them to collect about one finger's      |
|     > worth of saliva (\~1 ml, 1 cm or ½ inch; foam doesn't count).  |
|     > This takes longer than you'd think, so entertain the crowd     |
|     > with DNA facts (*"Where is the DNA in your saliva? If you      |
|     > collected all the DNA from a single cell and stretched it end  |
|     > to end, how long would it be? If you collected all the DNA     |
|     > from every cell in your body and stretched it end-to-end, how  |
|     > long would it be?"*). Some people will take much longer to     |
|     > collect saliva than others, but how long they try seems to     |
|     > matter more than how much liquid they produce. Make sure to    |
|     > have paper towels and wet wipes available because some people  |
|     > just cannot aim.                                               |
|                                                                      |
| 3.  Dispense one drop of dish soap from the squeeze bottle into each |
|     > sample tube. Note that participants should always hold their   |
|     > own tube. Tell participants to close the tube with their thumb |
|     > and slowly invert a couple times to mix. Don't shake because   |
|     > that will create more foam. "*Who remembers how soap works?*"  |
|     > Soap breaks down fats, and the membrane around our cells is    |
|     > essentially made out of fats. So adding soap will burst the    |
|     > cells in your saliva and spill out their DNA.                  |
|                                                                      |
| 4.  At this point, the DNA is actually *soluble* in water: the       |
|     > charges along the backbone of the DNA interact with water      |
|     > molecules and keep it dissolved. We can counteract those       |
|     > changes by adding some table salt, which will help the DNA to  |
|     > come out of solution. Dispense a small amount of salt into     |
|     > each tube and tell participants to mix it in by inverting a    |
|     > couple of times.                                               |
|                                                                      |
| 5.  Optional: There are all sorts of proteins stuck to the DNA at    |
|     > this point. Plus, the mixture also contains some enzymes that  |
|     > will degrade DNA. We can get rid of those proteins by adding   |
|     > some meat tenderizer. Meat tenderizer consists of bromelain or |
|     > papain---these are proteases, that is, enzymes that break down |
|     > protein. If your mouth hurts from eating too much raw          |
|     > pineapple, that's because the lining of your mouth is being    |
|     > digested by the bromelain in pineapple. Adding the meat        |
|     > tenderizer will result in more pure DNA that should also last  |
|     > longer. (This step is educational, but I've never seen much    |
|     > practical difference, so skip if you feel the demo is dragging |
|     > on too long.)                                                  |
|                                                                      |
| 6.  We need some way to pull the DNA out from all the other          |
|     > components of the saliva. Luckily, since we've just made the   |
|     > DNA insoluble in water, it would rather be in rubbing alcohol  |
|     > than in the watery saliva. Use the squeeze bottle to gently    |
|     > dispense isopropanol into the tube until almost full.          |
|     > Translucent strands of tangled DNA, typically coated in tiny   |
|     > bubbles, should rise to the top with the isopropanol.          |
|                                                                      |
| 7.  Optional: Hand each participant a toothpick. Tell them to try    |
|     > snag some DNA with the toothpick, then roll the string of DNA  |
|     > it up on the toothpick. Now they can walk around with their    |
|     > DNA on a stick. This used to be a valuable lab skill decades   |
|     > ago. Nowadays, we work with such tiny amounts of DNA that the  |
|     > DNA is barely visible. But we still use the same principles to |
|     > extract DNA: detergents, salts, often alcohol extraction.      |
|                                                                      |
| 8.  Make sure the participants dispose of their sampling tubes in    |
|     > the trash can with waterproof liner that you've set out for    |
|     > this purpose. Or bring caps for the tubes, in case anyone      |
|     > wants to take their DNA with them. Offer paper towels or wet   |
|     > wipes if people want to clean their hands.                     |
|                                                                      |
| Whenever you leave the demo station, make sure to dispose of your    |
| gloves, and disinfect your hands with wet wipes, or isopropanol and  |
| paper towels. It is a good idea to also regularly wipe down the      |
| table and disinfect the outside of all the containers to avoid       |
| cross-contamination. At the end of the day, the trash bag should be  |
| safe to dispose in household waste (you've already thoroughly        |
| disinfected most of the saliva using soap, salt, and alcohol). If    |
| you suspect the venue where you are doing this demo may be squeamish |
| about a trash bag full of lab gloves and spit tubes, you may want to |
| bring the trash bag back to your lab for disposal.                   |

Bring Your Cleanup Supplies
---------------------------

Think ahead---what would you do if someone drops whatever you're
bringing to an outside location? Or spills it all over themselves? If
you are planning to do biology outside a lab, these are some of the
supplies you may likely want to bring:

-   Gloves---including XS if working with kids

-   Roll(s) of paper towel

-   Wet wipes

-   Isopropanol (note that isopropanol can stain vinyl or wood
    > floors---you may want to bring a second disinfectant such as a
    > quaternary ammonium spray bottle as well)

-   Goggles and lab coats, depending on the splash hazard of the
    > activity

-   Thin plastic painter's tarp to cover floor and tables, if your host
    > requires it.

Education & Public Engagement Resources Developed by iGEM Teams
---------------------------------------------------------------

The yearly iGEM synthetic Biology competition has long had an "Education
and Public Engagement" component. The William & Mary team created an
Outreach Database containing 2700 outreach events and activities held by
iGEM teams that won Gold medals.

Here are a few notable resources:

-   [[2019 William & Mary Outreach
    > Database]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Software)
    > and [[Github
    > link]{.ul}](http://github.com/jasonlin45/outreach_database)

-   William & Mary 2017 also created [[Synthetic Biology Activities
    > booklets]{.ul}](http://2017.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Activites_Booklet)
    > for Grades
    > [[K-5]{.ul}](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/91/T--William_and_Mary--k-5.pdf),
    > [[6-8]{.ul}](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/0/0e/T--William_and_Mary--6-8.pdf),
    > and
    > [[9-12]{.ul}](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/c/cb/T--William_and_Mary--9-122.pdf)

-   Aachen 2016 created a [[book of
    > experiments]{.ul}](http://2016.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b9/T--Aachen--Experimentesammlung_fuer_Lehrer_safety_external_wiki.pdf)
    > that do not require equipment for teachers to more easily teach
    > biology (in German).

-   Washington 2019 developed a 200+ page outreach curriculum, and got
    > it translated into 16 languages---see
    > [[https://2019.igem.org/Team:Washington/Public_Engagement]{.ul}](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Washington/Public_Engagement)
