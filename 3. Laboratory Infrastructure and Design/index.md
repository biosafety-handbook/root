## Finding a Lab Location and Getting Started {#finding-a-lab-location-and-getting-started}

Community biology labs come in all shapes and sizes. Whether starting a lab from scratch or converting a garage or other space, there are some common infrastructure and design aspects that are important to keep in mind. First, before thinking about the inside of the lab, consider the outside and the building that will house the community lab. When searching for a location, consider the following:



*   **Zoning. **City zoning laws specify how property in specific locations may be used. For example, city officials will define whether a particular area can be residential, commercial, or mixed-use. If the community lab is going to be used as a business, it will need to be located in a zone that allows for commercial use. Zoning may also affect where labs can be located, where externally vented chemical hoods can be used, etc. Contact the local public works office for more information. 
*   **Neighborhood.** Consider if the neighbors are biotech friendly ahead of time. Neighbors are an important part of the community and can be advocates for the organization. Get to know them and invite them to tour the facility and participate in educational opportunities. Also, consider who might be uncomfortable with a lab next door, such as restaurants. Make a point of establishing rapport with such businesses.
*   **Access.** Consider whether the location is accessible by public transit and if parking is available. Also, consider local events, such as sporting matches, that may take place in the area. Additionally, consider access for persons with disabilities. Review the [ADA’s Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities](https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf) for more information. 
*   **Safety and security.** Consider the safety of the area, surrounding lighting, and surveillance options if in a high crime area. 
*   **Building infrastructure**. Consider whether the building has a sprinkler system, a loading dock, or doors wide enough for large equipment such as a -80°C freezer or a biosafety cabinet to pass through. It is advisable to have more than one exit from the labspace. You’ll need an available sink. Another consideration is power—how many electrical outlets are available and what is the maximum load on the main breaker panel? Other considerations include: are there separate rooms you could rent out? Is there a kitchen area that is well-separated from the lab? Is there a large room outside the lab that can be used as a lecture area or classroom? 


## Environmental and Health Considerations {#environmental-and-health-considerations}

Once a space has been identified or inherited, consider the following environmental issues: 



*   **Potentially contaminated sites. **Before settling on a location, determine past uses of the land and the facility. Determine if hazardous materials still exist on the property. One way to do this in the U.S. is to visit the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) website of known [Superfund Sites](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live) or ToxMap [http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov](http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov). 
*   **Asbestos. **Asbestos is a natural mineral that is known to cause cancer if inhaled. Be aware that flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, pipe wrappings, and insulation may contain asbestos. Visit the U.S. EPA’s [asbestos website]( https://www.epa.gov/asbestos) to learn more about asbestos and to find local vendors who can assist with asbestos remediation.
*   **Radioactivity**. Radioactivity testing should be performed and decontaminated if discovered. Contact a radiation safety company to assess potential radiation contamination. 
*   **Mercury.** Mercury can be found in many products, such as thermometers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, manometers, and other pieces of scientific equipment. Be aware that mercury may be found in sink traps or under floor tiles if the space was ever previously used as a lab or was part of a production facility that used mercury. Visit the EPA’s [mercury website](https://www.epa.gov/mercury) for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with mercury remediation. 
*   **Lead and lead paint**. Lead was banned from U.S. paint products in 1978 but may still be used in other countries. Buildings and structures with lead paint require special precautions, especially if the paint will be removed. You can buy community lead testing kits online or at your local home improvement store. Visit the EPA’s [lead website](https://www.epa.gov/lead) for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with lead remediation. 
*   **Natural disaster zones**. Consider the location of the community facility and whether it will be located in a [flood](https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home), fire hazards, landslide, earthquake liquefaction, or other zone prone to natural disasters. Be aware that some insurance companies will not provide flood insurance to facilities in flood zones. Contact an insurance company to determine if the facility is in a flood zone.


## Establishing Contact with Local Agencies {#establishing-contact-with-local-agencies}

We recommend establishing rapport with key personnel at local fire departments, police precincts, and hospitals, so that if an incident does occur, first responders and police are familiar with your lab, its mission, and operations. Establishing such relationships could preempt misunderstandings about your lab’s purpose, aid in the response to an incident, establish champions of the lab in the community, and help provide advice in lab safety and security and local ordinances. 

After establishing your lab, reach out to your local fire and police department before any potential incident. Invite them for a tour of the lab or to a community event to give them a sense of the lab facilities and activities. A few examples of local agencies to contact include:



*   **Local fire departments.** In some areas, community labs may need a permit from the local fire department. Before building the lab, it is a good idea to contact the local fire department and find out about the local requirements. Typical fire codes set allowances on the amounts of hazardous chemicals in a building and can require additional fire protection (such as fire sprinklers) depending on the local zoning requirements, the materials used in the facility, and the materials used in the construction or renovation of the building. Contacting the fire department early in the process is helpful for identifying these requirements. 
*   **Public Health Department.** Inquire with the local Public Health Department to find out about health codes that pertain to labs or if there are reporting requirements in the event of an exposure or accident. In different localities, you may also be required to contact branches dedicated to the management of chemical and regulated medical waste.
*   **Local Chamber of Commerce or neighborhood association.** Some community labs have successfully obtained support from their local chambers of commerce, which has more deeply integrated them into their communities. Consider asking chamber officials to visit your lab and inviting potential funding groups to tour when they visit your city. 
*   **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or Local Law Enforcement Agencies.** Many community labs have found it beneficial to establish relationships with agents at local FBI offices to identify and address any misconceptions of the nature of the research happening in the lab. For advice on how to reach out to the FBI, contact the heads of community labs in the U.S. (e.g., Biocurious, Genspace).


## Lab Infrastructure and Design {#lab-infrastructure-and-design}

When setting up a community biology lab, consider the equipment and materials you will use and the basic infrastructure required to handle them. Whether setting up a space for the first time, moving to a new space, or settling into the space, consider the following list of recommendations for the infrastructure and design of a biology lab.

 



*   **Walls and floors.** The lab walls, ceilings, and floors should be smooth, impermeable to liquids and easy to clean. Walls should be fire resistant with no carpet or flammable materials on the wall or barriers. Walls and entryways should separate the lab from non-lab areas. Floors should be slip-resistant, durable, and easily cleaned. Floors should not be carpeted because the fabric may absorb chemicals and dirt and is very difficult to clean. Chemicals that soak into carpet may also cause reactions long after the chemical spill. Carpet may also become a breeding ground for microbes. 
*   **Benchtops**. Benchtops should be impermeable to liquids, including disinfectants, and other chemicals such as acids and solvents. Benchtops should be resistant to scratches, impact, and heat. They should not have open seams and should be easy to clean and decontaminate. If your benchtops are wooden, or if only wood benches are available, make sure that they are sealed with an impermeable surface, such as a sealed tile or epoxy coating. Porous materials such as wood veneer products should be avoided as they will absorb chemicals and water and will weaken over time. Wood-grain plastic laminate or phenolic resin may provide an acceptable alternative. Previously used [stainless steel food preparation tables](https://smile.amazon.com/Commercial-Kitchen-Restaurant-Stainless-Steel/dp/B07NMVW251/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_3905707922?_encoding=UTF8&adgrpid=60709731045&hvadid=312354211593&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032171&hvnetw=g&hvpone=&hvpos=1o5&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvrand=7987463943959713330&hvtargid=aud-643574997066%3Apla-571545667818&ie=UTF8&linkCode=df0&ref=&tag=hyprod-20&th=1) (shown below) may be purchased and make wonderful lab benches (30 inch x 60 inch tables are approximately $130 new). Furniture stores, such as Ikea, sell tempered glass and all-metal tables, but be wary of fiberboard or laminate filled products. 
*   **Sink**. A sink for handwashing,dishwashing, and for disposal of non-toxic and non-hazardous liquids should be provided. Sinks should be located near the exit door. If this is not possible, ensure the sink is located as close to the lab as possible. A gooseneck or adjustable faucet and deep pan sink are highly recommended. Many stainless steel sinks from restaurants going out of business are available from auction sales and make wonderful lab sinks. A dish rack for drying glassware that drains into the sink is also helpful. The sink should never be located in an area that is used for food preparation. If running water is not available, containers of water and hand sanitizer must be available. A portable handwashing station with clean and dirty water containers may be an acceptable solution as long as it is emptied and refilled on a regular basis. 
*   **Lab furniture.** Chairs and stools should be non-porous and easily cleaned. Chairs made of vinyl, hard plastic, and hard rubber make good choices. Plastic coverings that can be easily cleaned may be used to cover cloth chairs. Benches and other lab furniture, such as shelving and cabinets, should be of a sturdy design and material to support equipment and storage items. The U.S. National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) lab [Design Requirements Manual (DRM)](https://www.orf.od.nih.gov/PoliciesAndGuidelines/Documents/DRM/DRM1.3032019.pdf) specifies that shelves should be able to hold 50 pounds per linear foot for 1 foot deep shelves. It is recommended that countertops be able to hold no less than 50 pounds per square foot. Shelving with adjustable height shelves are recommended. If located in a seismically active area, restraints and anchorage for shelving and cabinets may be necessary and is often required by local building codes.
*   **Storage space**. Community labs often get their supplies and equipment from donations, auctions, or discount sales. It is important to have adequate storage space for and consider storage requirements for frequently accessed items as well as “deep storage” for less frequently used items. We recommend creating clearly labeled storage spaces inside and outside the lab and discouraging clutter on benchtops or in aisles. Make it easy to see what is stored where: consider using well-labeled and transparent boxes to easily see the contents. 
*   **PPE storage space**. Storage space for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as lab coats, gloves, and goggles, should be available throughout the lab. Make sure that any workstation or equipment that requires PPE is labeled with a sign. PPE should be stationed at the lab entrance with signage and available to visitors to the space.
*   **Personal storage space**. Non-lab items such as coats and bags should be stored outside the lab (e.g., on coat racks, hooks, cubbies, closet). Personal or project storage space on shelves and in fridges or freezers is usually allowed at the discretion of lab management. All items should be clearly labeled with the owner's name and the contents. 
*   **Office space**. Demarcate space for eating, drinking, class, or office work that is outside the lab. Check local zoning requirements to determine if labs and offices must be physically separated. 
*   **Lighting.** The lab should have adequate lighting for work at all times during the day. We recommend providing task lighting at the bench or directly by work areas if possible. Reflections and glare should be avoided. Areas containing equipment with ultraviolet (UV) lighting should be limited to those doing work when UV lamps are on, which should only be as necessary. When possible, use a self-timing light switch in rooms that are seldom used as the switches can save a significant amount of money. It is also a good idea to have access to emergency lighting, such as a flashlight, in the case of an electrical outage. Glow-in-the-dark signs can be used to guide lab users to the flashlight and other safety equipment.
*   **Doors.** If possible, doors to the lab should have vision panels, be self-closing, and have the appropriate [fire rating](https://community.nfpa.org/community/nfpa-today/blog/2018/01/24/101wednesdays-regarding-fire-doors-what-rating-do-i-need). Locking doors with restricted access is important for the prevention of theft, as well as for the physical safety of the lab users. Always ensure that the doors have the proper emergency egress opening direction and are outfitted with panic bars or emergency door release buttons if necessary (check your local fire department). Consider egress routes in the event of an emergency. It is advisable to have two exits from the lab.
*   **Electricity.** Biolabs tend to require greater electrical loads than commercial office spaces. You can estimate the loads you need by adding up the wattage used by individual pieces in the lab. Be sure to tally continuously-on loads (such as fridges and freezers) versus peak loads (such as autoclaves or large centrifuges). You can also do load testing to identify your power needs. All electrical work should be up to code. Make sure the breaker panel is carefully labeled with what circuits or equipment each breaker powers, so they can be safely deactivated in case of emergency. It may be useful to also label each outlet with the number of the breaker that powers it. Check that all power cords are in good condition (especially with older second-hand equipment) and rated for the amperage of the equipment (see [Chapter 9 - Equipment Usage/Safety](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0)). Many labs start small and grow over time, so it is important to anticipate a higher energy load in the long term. Make sure power is available away from wall sockets. Power drops from the ceiling are not expensive and may save lab personnel from daisy-chaining power cords (which are trip and fire hazards and are likely to violate fire ordinances). Temperature and energy input monitors on important equipment (such as ultra-low temperature freezers) can provide early warning before equipment failures. If possible, it is desirable to have a generator for use with essential equipment like incubators and freezers incase of an electrical outage.
*   **Electrical safety devices**. Labs should have Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) in the electrical receptacles in order to minimize the risks associated with electrical equipment (e.g., shock, electrocution). The GFCI should be tested at least once a year, because they can corrode or become damaged. Learn how to perform a test [here](https://inspectapedia.com/electric/GFCI-Test-Procedures.php). 
*   **Eyewash and shower**. We recommend providing access to an eyewash station, which may also be required by safety regulations. Eyewashes can be plumbed in or you can buy single-use squirt bottles with sterile saline solution (don’t worry they’re cheap!). Remember that: 
    *   Eyewash stations have a limited lifetime and need to be replaced; set calendar reminders to do so. 
    *   Fixed eyewash stations should be flushed monthly or per local regulations. 

    Emergency showers are typically only required if lab users will be exposed to “injurious corrosive materials” ([ANSI 358.1). ](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/07/emergency-eyewash-station-shower-ansi-z358-1/#gref)Refer to the international standard [ANSI 358.1](https://blog.ansi.org/2018/07/emergency-eyewash-station-shower-ansi-z358-1/#gref) for additional recommendations for eyewashes and shower equipment. 

*   **Fire safety equipment.** Fire extinguishers and smoke detectors are often legally required. It is also advisable (and often required) for the lab to have sprinklers and a fire alarm. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes require labs to carry fire suppression equipment such as fire extinguishers and fire sprinkler heads. Fire extinguishers should use carbon dioxide or dry chemical (type A-B-C extinguishers) to put out fires. Water is not a good option for labs. If you use combustible metals such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, consider Type D fire extinguishers, which also use a dry chemical but dispense it more gently. If you plan to work with highly flammable materials, first consult with your local fire department. We also recommend keeping a fire blanket on hand. Local fire departments and fire service companies may inspect and fill fire extinguishers and offer free training on their use. Fire extinguishers must be inspected by a certified inspector annually.  [Refer to Chapter 6 Emergency Procedures for more information on Fire Safety.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EPvDUiT99IYeUYyCBV6huDEGlorgYYbkAZze0YaUcA/edit#heading=h.jj8eb4yencmb) 
*   **Ventilation**. If building a lab, consideration should be given to installing a ventilation system that provides inward airflow without recirculation. Many community labs moving into existing buildings will not have that option but heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals may be able to balance the air in the lab to create a small negative pressure. If mechanical ventilation is not available, windows can be opened but should be fitted with screens to prevent insects from entering the space. If you’re able to design the lab, ensure it has separate air handling units for offices, bathrooms, and other spaces. Chemical fume hoods and biological safety cabinets may require their own ventilation and space considerations.


## Signage {#signage}

The lab is often full of signs, which is a good thing and important for the safety of users. Many signs tend to go unnoticed by very regular users of the lab. That said, signs serve as useful reminders and are especially important for new users and for emergency responders to the lab. Signs also instruct users where things are and help them understand the lab rules (see some example signs from [BioCurious](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByIgvp7w4IABNDFjYTk2MzQtYmEzNC00ODAxLTljNTYtNmQxN2I2MzkzYjAx)). Signage that indicates who to contact and what to do in an emergency should be posted in conspicuous locations throughout the building. 

Below is a list of signs that are useful and often required in the lab: 

**Location Signs**



*   **Exits**. It is especially useful, and sometimes required by law, to have signs indicating where the exits to the lab and building are located in the event of an emergency and when people need to exit quickly. 
*   **Fire extinguishers.** Signage should be posted to identify the location of the extinguisher. Also, consider posting details regarding how to use the extinguisher.
*   **First aid kit.** The first aid station safety symbol should be used as it indicates the location and availability of a first aid kit.
*   **Eyewash station and safety shower.** Signs to identify the location and availability of an eyewash station and safety shower are important.
*   **Escape route. **A sign that shows the various egress routes in the case of an emergency should be posted.


## 

**Warnings, Caution Signs, and Symbols**



*   **Biohazard symbol.** The biohazard symbol warns of lab equipment (e.g., fridges, freezers, centrifuges) that contains biohazardous materials or could be contaminated with biohazardous materials. These should only be used if the material warrants posting such signage, e.g., the material is classified as Biosafety Level 2 (see [Chapter 13 - Biological Safety](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk)) and is likely or known to contain pathogens. This could include materials such as blood samples or primary human cell lines. 
*   **High voltage. **The high voltage warning symbol, which includes a lightning bolt arrow in a yellow triangle, warns of voltage high enough to cause serious injury or death. If working with high voltage, consider using an isolation transformer and other appropriate high-voltage safeguards and PPE. You can find guidance on this topic elsewhere—this handbook focuses primarily on biological and chemical safety. Signage should be posted that indicates how to turn off the main power in case of an accident or emergency.
*   **Specific dangers. **Additional signage that identifies specific hazardous areas/equipment should be posted. Examples include: Wet Floor; Sonicating - Do Not Enter; UV Light; Lasers in Use; Cryogens; and Compressed Gas. Some signs will be required by law in certain places but not others so check local requirements.  

**Etiquette Reminders**



*   **No eating/drinking.** Inform lab members that eating and/or drinking where hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored is not permitted. Eating and drinking may result in the accidental ingestion of hazardous materials, and food and beverages could also contaminate your lab experiments. Food or drink containers and utensils should not be stored, washed, or dried in the lab. Refrigerators used for storage of research materials must not be used for storage of food or beverages.  
*   **Labeling reminders.** Remind lab users to properly label their materials and reagents with the name of the chemical or biological agent, their name, and the date, so that other members of the lab are aware of the contents.
*   **Hand washing.** Reminds lab users to wash their hands both before beginning work and when they are finished.
*   **No open flame.** Prohibits open flame devices, e.g., bunsen burners. These are especially useful near flammable chemicals, although some labs enforce a “no open flame” policy throughout the lab.
*   **Waste.** Helps to ensure that users know where to dispose of biohazardous waste versus recycling or regular trash.


## 

**Chemical Signage**



*   Use signage to demarcate storage locations, cabinets, and equipment that is dedicated for acids, bases, and flammables.
*   Organize stock chemicals by type, alphabetically, or other system (e.g., [Flinn system](https://www.flinnsci.com/shelf-storage-pattern/dcat024/)).
    *   Label storage areas clearly so that chemicals can easily be put back in the same location they were taken from.
*   Include signs pointing out the location of and instructions for [how to handle chemical spills](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d21Y1GKdQOCveWHRxN33DnCbW2KnILwB/view?usp=sharing)**. **
*   Refer to [Chapter 10 - Chemical Safety](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E) for more details on chemical safety, storage, and signage. 

**PPE Reminder Signage **



*   Post signage in areas where extreme heat or cold is located. Always wear heat-resistant gloves for handling items coming out of the autoclave or microwave, as well as reminders for handling cold items with protective gloves.
*   Incompatible glove signage should also be posted at corrosive cabinets or chemical fume hoods as a reminder.
*   Reminders should be posted that describe when it is and isn’t appropriate to wear PPE, such as signs on exit doors reminding people to remove lab coats and gloves before leaving the lab.

**Emergency Contact Information**



*   Provide contact information for each of the following:
    *   The lab manager(s), staff, or volunteers in charge.
    *   Any building personnel that can be reached in an emergency.
    *   Local fire department.
    *   Local police department. 
    *   911, or country equivalent, emergency response number. 
    *   For freezer emergencies, you may also want to post the nearest locations that sell dry ice.


## Types of Labs and Specific Considerations {#types-of-labs-and-specific-considerations}

This section provides special guidance for different types of community lab facilities. 



*   **Rented Dedicated Lab Space. **A number of community labs rent dedicated space from a commercial landlord. It’s important to know the zoning for such a space (usually biology labs require industrial or mixed-use zoning but as with everything it depends on local laws). It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord has a clear understanding of the types of activities at your lab, your users, power usage, policies, and hours. The more the landlord knows at the outset, the smoother your relationship will be, and the less potential for conflict in the case of an incident. We recommend occasionally inviting the landlord into the lab as a way to establish a good working relationship.
*   **Kitchen or Other Home Lab. **The most challenging aspect of the design of a home lab is the separation of the lab space from the living space. It is important not to eat or drink in the space where work is being performed. Avoid setting up a lab on carpeted flooring and make sure that walls and furniture are impermeable (or cover them with plastic tarp). Small dorm fridges and freezers can be bought cheaply second-hand in any college town. If you have roommates or family members who share the space, you may want to mark off the space and establish an understanding about access and safety in the lab.
*   **Basement or Garage Lab.** Paying attention to the airflow in a garage or basement lab is critical. Too much airflow may increase chances for sample contamination, but too little may not provide adequate ventilation for users. Moisture and mold may also be an issue—you can check mold levels using a simple petri dish kit available at many home improvement stores.

     

*   **Makerspace (Conjoined or Mixed Use).** Separation of spaces to reduce dust and vibration is important in a biolab within a makerspace. It’s essential to protect the bio area from other makerspace members who may not appreciate the special needs of a biolab. Chemicals and biologicals should be stored in cabinets away from the shared space.
*   **Library.** Separate porous library books from lab space. 
*   **University Spaces.** Be aware of rules and regulations of the host institution and incorporate them into the policies of your own lab space. We also recommend scheduling regular check-ins with the management of the host institution and outreach events for your neighbors. Be sure to mark off the lab from other spaces in the host facility with lockable doors and clear signage.
*   **Mobile Lab (e.g., a Van or a Container).** Mobile labs come with special considerations about establishing resilient containment practices for chemicals and organisms. Accidental environmental releases or spills are especially a concern with mobile units that could be involved in traffic accidents. Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles or equivalent governing institution for proper signage and containment procedures for these units.

     



## Opening the Lab {#opening-the-lab}

Before work commences, it is a good idea to review the experimental setup to check for any missing items that will help ensure a safe lab experience for users. [This checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjM2dbTXLQmATVbjQBWDfz5ocBT9KLeeE7LuHUzGWBA/edit?usp=sharing) may be used upon moving into the lab. It can also be used for conducting regular safety checks of the lab.

## Decommissioning a Lab {#decommissioning-a-lab}

When relocating, renovating, or simply closing a lab, it may be necessary to completely decommission the space. Ensure that no lab materials are left behind and that all lab equipment, fixtures, furniture, and space are properly cleaned and decontaminated to ensure the safety of future occupants and others who may enter the space. You may be legally required to perform a hazardous materials (chemical and biological) walk-through upon ending your lease,which might involve county or state documentation of disposal and closing permitting on sites.   

The steps involved in decommissioning involve the following:


### Assess and Audit {#assess-and-audit}



*   Assess any hazards that may need attention (e.g., historic records of spills or accidents, known areas of contamination).
*   Determine the amount of time needed to decommission, and plan to end research in the lab 1-2 weeks before starting the process.


### Clearout and Decontaminate {#clearout-and-decontaminate}



*   Remove all chemicals and biological materials from lab and storage areas, including refrigerators and freezers. 
*   Movable equipment should be appropriately cleaned and/or disinfected and removed from the lab.
*   Decontaminate all surfaces of any chemical or biological contamination. Pay particular attention to ethidium bromide contamination in gel electrophoresis areas.
*   If mercury has been used in the lab, decommissioning should include testing of floors (or under floor tiles), sink traps, cupboards, and molding around furniture and walls. Contact a local remediation company or a nearby college or university to determine if a [Jerome meter](https://www.azic.com/jerome/jerome-431/) may be used to test for mercury.
*   Remove dust and other settled particulates via a thorough final wet-cleaning of floors, vertical surfaces, and furniture using commercial cleaning products.


### Documentation {#documentation}



*   Keep notes of all of the processes.

This [Decommissioning Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zjM2dbTXLQmATVbjQBWDfz5ocBT9KLeeE7LuHUzGWBA/edit?usp=sharing) may be used to help keep track of all of the items to inspect and complete when decommissioning the lab.
