## Taking Your Science Outside the Lab {#taking-your-science-outside-the-lab}

Taking your science outside of the carefully controlled laboratory environment offers some wonderful opportunities to bring it to a wider audience, but it can also pose its own unique biosafety challenges.

Make sure to review [Acquiring, Shipping, and Transporting Materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit) for any issues regarding transporting materials to and from the venue. If you do take genetically engineered strains somewhere, make sure to take precautions against spillage (you may want to take a spill kit with you, including enough bleach or other disinfectant to kill any organisms that did spill), and never let anyone else take any of the organisms home. Giving any genetically engineered organism to someone who does not have a lab to handle it properly could be considered an unauthorized environmental release. Some labs have used waiver forms to allow participants to take materials home with them, where the participant assumes all responsibility for proper disposal (e.g., submerging in bleach), but it is unclear what legal weights such a waiver has if you know that the recipient will be taking it somewhere other than an actual lab. 

Always make sure the venue owner knows what you intend to do, and what you intend to bring, and be respectful of any restrictions or special precautions they may require. For example, a venue might prohibit you from bringing any genetically engineered organisms, or may require you to cover all surfaces with plastic. Some art museums may impose a lengthy approval process to bring any biological materials on-site because they may have fragile and valuable collections to protect.

Here are some venues that you might encounter, and specific biosafety challenges they may pose:


## Maker Faire or Other Indoor Fair {#maker-faire-or-other-indoor-fair}

Large public events—especially with young children present under various degrees of supervision—may require some forethought to keep your science safe. Even if you do not bring any live cultures, glassware and other equipment can break and hurt people. Are you prepared to deal with a situation where a 2 year old in a stroller grabs something from your table and puts it in their mouth while you’re having a conversation with their parents? Or when a rambunctious 5 year old pulls on the table cloth covering your booth and causes some of your science to come crashing down? We recommend that you secure tablecloths by tying them to the table legs or by taping or clamping them to the table. Also make sure that any cultures, fragile pieces of equipment, or glassware are out of reach of small fingers.

If you do bring live cultures or genetically engineered organisms to a public event like this, make sure they are properly contained to avoid any exposure and always under direct control of someone from your lab who is trained to work with them. Don’t leave Petri plates lying around on your booth or else someone may walk off with them.


## Street Fair or Other Open Air Fair {#street-fair-or-other-open-air-fair}

Open air venues are subject to the same challenges as indoor fairs, plus weather! You may want to protect booth staff and any biological materials by investing in a collapsible 10’x10’ canopy tent. Plan for inclement weather, such as high wind and rain. Sudden wind gusts can lift up your canopy or even cause another exhibitor’s canopy to crash into yours. So make sure your canopy is weighted or tied down securely, bring paper weights for any flyers or signs on your table, and limit the amount of breakable glassware or spillable biological cultures you may have on display.


## Library or Classroom {#library-or-classroom}

Regulation and insurance issues can make it difficult to work with kids at your community lab. So why not go somewhere that is already set up to deal with kids such as your local library or schools? 

Make sure the materials you are presenting are age appropriate and vetted extra carefully for biosafety. Keep in mind that you will be working with children who may not yet have fully developed immune systems (and/or highly litigious parents!), and keep that into account for your Risk Assessment. For example, you may want to avoid working with organisms that are technically considered Risk Group 1 but can pose some health risks, such as _Serratia marcescens_. Depending on the age of the children, you may also need to avoid using sharp scissors or scalpels, etc.

Do not collect any information from the kids (including emails and photographs) without explicit consent from their parents or guardian. The school or library should be able to tell you what their rules are around such things and may be able to assist you in contacting the kids after the event (e.g., to send them some pictures of the agar art they made).


## Non-bio Makerspace {#non-bio-makerspace}

Adults with preconceived notions of acceptable risk and safety levels can sometimes be harder to handle than kids that have no such notions. If you go to do a hands-on science demo in a space that has very different expectations around safety, be aware that some of the “regulars” there may disregard or ridicule your safety instructions. Familiarize yourself with the space and its safety culture in advance and adjust your presentation accordingly, either by paying more attention to the safety instructions or by omitting demonstrations that you expect cannot be done safely in such an environment. Make sure you have one of the managers of the other makerspace there and that they are willing to back you up on safety issues if necessary.


## Bar / Social Event (e.g., Nerdnite, Pint of Science) {#bar-social-event-e-g-nerdnite-pint-of-science}

Doing an interesting science event at a bar or similar venue is all about managing expectations. You may be able to rope off part of the space to do a hands-on demo under more controllable conditions. Or perhaps stick to an activity involving nothing but safe household ingredients, such as the Extracting DNA from Spit demo listed below.

 

Be prepared to have to deal with people who are inebriated and/or have completely no interest or understanding of what you are doing. And yes, if you bring a fluorescent yeast culture, someone will try to drink it. 


## Science Museum {#science-museum}

Science museums can be a joy to work with because they typically already have a good understanding of the safety and waste disposal issues you will have to deal with. Get to know your local science museum.** **They are a great way to get the word out about what you are doing, and they typically welcome anything that will expose their patrons to a wider range of topics and experiences.


## Art Museum {#art-museum}

One of the top priorities for any art museum will be to protect the valuable collections they house. Unless they have dealt with Bio Art before and worked out some streamlined protocols, expect to have to work through documentation and some questions from the conservation team. Art museums may require sterilization of all materials or building special enclosures to avoid any cross-contamination (or just to avoid upsetting the careful humidity control in their exhibit space).

Example Outreach Activity: Agar Art
An Agar Art workshop can provide for a simple, artistic introduction to microbiology and genetically engineered bacteria for kids or adults alike. Count on a minimum of 2 hours, with a substantial amount of prep and follow-up time. Consider doing a series of workshops, so participants get a chance to improve their skills in this novel medium. Here is how Counter Culture Labs does this demo, with special focus on the biosafety aspects.

Venue 
Make sure the venue owners know what you will be working with, including any genetically engineered organisms. Visit the site in advance and check what table and floor surfaces you will be working on. Be prepared to cover any porous table or floor surfaces with plastic sheeting if necessary (or whenever the venue owner wishes to). Make sure your demo area is close to a restroom or handwashing sink for participants to use. 

Prepare in advance
2-6 pigmented bacterial cultures to work with. For beginners, we recommend using a set of fluorescent or chromogenic E. coli strains that can all be grown with the same growth medium and antibiotic. We typically work with liquid cultures and fine paint brushes. For best result, prepare liquid cultures with the appropriate antibiotic overnight or no more than a day and a half in advance. Others have had good results using plate cultures, and using inoculation loops or autoclaved toothpicks or skewers. Also prepare with appropriate growth medium and antibiotics. Using 2% agar makes the surface a bit easier to work with than the standard 1.5% agar plates. Let plates dry out a bit after pouring, and store at room temperature to avoid condensation.

Supplies to bring
Liquid cultures in screwcap bottles or flasks securely closed with parafilm to avoid spillage, transported inside plastic bin to contain spills
Selection of markers in the same colors as the bacterial cultures
Sheets of paper—at least 1 for each participant
Prepoured Petri plates (at least 1 or 2 per participant), plus one blank plate to use as a template
Very fine paint brushes (we found some online that were only $16 for 60, and we've been able to autoclave them 6-7 times now). Color code the end of each brush with one of the bacterial culture colors using colored tape.
Wide mouth jars (12-16oz / 350-500ml), color coded with each of the bacterial culture colors, using colored tape. At least one set of jars of each color for every 6-8 participants.
One larger jar or beaker for every 6-8 participants to collect used brushes
Plastic sheeting or tarp to cover porous tables or floor if necessary
Selection of glove sizes for all participants (including XS if working with kids)
Bottle of isopropanol
Paper towels and wet wipes
Surface disinfectant, e.g., quaternary ammonium spray bottle
Waterproof trash bag/container
Bring at least one workshop assistant plus ideally one additional assistant for every 10-15 participants.

Agar Art workshop

Show examples of agar art for inspiration. You could do a half hour slideshow, or skip this step altogether to avoid contaminating people's creativity.
Notify participants in advance that they will NOT be able to take any plates with genetically engineered cultures home with them.
Explain that making agar art is a bit like painting with invisible ink, so we will be creating a design on paper first, placing it underneath the Petri plate, and then tracing over the design with the bacterial culture.
Hand out sheets of paper and tell participants to draw circles using a blank Petri plate as template (a letter-sized sheet fits 6 standard Petri plate-sized circles).
Provide markers in the same colors as the bacterial cultures the participants will be working with, and ask them to draw their design on paper first. 
While they are working, you can come by with premade plates showing each of the bacterial cultures after they've developed into colonies on agar. Wear gloves while holding the plates, and do not let participants touch them without gloves.
After everybody is finished with their designs, remove all the markers, excess paper and any food, drink, or personal possessions from the table. Only their paper designs should be left. Participants may want to take a picture of their paper designs at this point because they will not be able to take them with them.
Have everybody put on gloves, and explain that they will be working with live bacterial cultures so no personal effects on the table, no eating or drinking, no touching their face, clothing, phone or anything else with gloves on. If they need to leave the table for any reason, have them remove gloves and wash hands (or wipe down hands with wet wipes) immediately. 
Carefully pour about ¼ inch / ½ cm bacterial culture in each of the color-coded jars, and provide each group of 4-8 participants with a set of jars with each culture. Place 10-20 correspondingly color-coded paint brushes in each jar. Each group also gets a larger waste jar for used brushes, filled with about an inch of isopropanol.
Explain there should be no double dipping to avoid cross-contamination between the different colored cultures. 
Provide each participant with one or two prepoured Petri plates. Have them place the plate over their paper design, so they can trace over it. You can stick the plate in place with double-sided tape, or put a mark on the side of the plate and on the paper to keep things aligned properly.
Tell them to leave the plate closed whenever possible and to not talk/cough/sneeze while the plate is open to avoid contamination. Since they are not working in a sterile field, some contamination may be expected
If participants are running out of fresh brushes, occasionally collect isopropanol-soaked, used brushes from the waste jars and put them into a separate jar. Clean brushes (including handles) with soap and water, then rinse extensively with tap water, dry them off with paper towels, and redistribute cleaned brushes back into the correspondingly color-coded culture jars.
Have participants label their plates with their name, email, and date on the lid of the plate. Do not label on the bottom of the plate because that will show up in any pictures of the agar art, and they may not want to share their email with the whole world. If you are concerned about opening plates with some contamination, you could ask them to write on the side of the lid instead, but be aware that some writing on the side may be legible in photos, depending on camera angle.
Show participants how to parafilm their plates. Make sure parafilm strips are cut thin enough to not obscure the artwork, but wide enough to form a good seal. 
Collect all parafilmed plates and take them back to your lab for incubation. Clean all brushes as described above. Pour any leftover bacterial culture back into closeable bottles. Rinse out jars with isopropanol. If you used plastic sheeting, you can spray it wet with isopropanol or quaternary ammonium disinfectant and roll it up wet for maximum contact time. Put all potentially contaminated materials—plates, jars, cleaned brushes, rolled up plastic sheeting, trash bag with used gloves, paper sheets with the original designs—in a plastic box and take them back to your lab for further cleaning or disposal, unless the venue owner has given explicit permission to dispose of some items there.
Thoroughly clean all surfaces with an appropriate surface disinfectant (e.g., quaternary ammonium spray). Make sure to test for material compatibility (e.g., isopropanol can stain vinyl or wood finishes), and allow sufficient contact time for the disinfectant used.
Leave the place cleaner than you found it.

Displaying your Agar Art

The agar plates will take a few days to develop and will be "at their prime" for a few days after. Beyond that, you will lose resolution due to the colonies outgrowing the original design. You may also start getting more contaminants growing on the plates. And if you wait long enough, the plates will start drying out and the colors will fade. We found that a good way to display the plates themselves while they are in the time window that they are worth looking at is by sandwiching them in between two plates of acrylic, held together with larger binder clips. A 17 inch (43cm) square display will fit 4x4 standard Petri plates. Carefully parafilm the Petri plates so they will not leak, and make sure there is a wide enough border around the plates to prevent fingers from reaching the plates from the sides. 
However, the absolutely best way to display your Agar Art is by taking some high-resolution images while the plates are at their peak, and get some high-quality prints to hang on your walls.

Example Outreach Activity: Extracting DNA from Spit
DNA extraction from spit is an easy 5 minute science demo that is perfect for a science fair. Here is how Counter Culture Labs does this demo, with special focus on the biosafety aspects.

Supplies to bring
Small squeeze bottle of dish washing soap (e.g., Dawn, but pretty much any liquid soap will work) 
Table salt—in a salt shaker with all but one large hole taped off
Isopropanol alcohol—in gooseneck or condiment squeeze bottle
Optional: meat tenderizer powder
Optional: toothpicks
Gloves, paper towels, wet wipes, waterproof trash bag/container

Note that the person running this demo should never be touching the tubes in which the participants are collecting their saliva. But just to be sure, wear gloves anyway. Participants don't need gloves because they will only be working with their own saliva. Disinfect hands/gloves with isopropanol or wet wipes as soon as possible if you do touch any of the saliva, to avoid cross-contaminating the bag of sampling tubes, for example.

Gather a group of participants from the people walking by your booth. If things are slow, it might help to shout "Who wants to see their DNA? Start spitting into this tube!".
Hand out one sampling tube to each participant. We usually use a bag of 5 ml polypropylene culture tubes: cheap, disposable and unlikely to break. Ask them to collect about one finger's worth of saliva (~1 ml, 1 cm or ½ inch; foam doesn't count). This takes longer than you'd think, so entertain the crowd with DNA facts ("Where is the DNA in your saliva? If you collected all the DNA from a single cell and stretched it end to end, how long would it be? If you collected all the DNA from every cell in your body and stretched it end-to-end, how long would it be?"). Some people will take much longer to collect saliva than others, but how long they try seems to matter more than how much liquid they produce. Make sure to have paper towels and wet wipes available because some people just cannot aim.
Dispense one drop of dish soap from the squeeze bottle into each sample tube. Note that participants should always hold their own tube. Tell participants to close the tube with their thumb and slowly invert a couple times to mix. Don't shake because that will create more foam. "Who remembers how soap works?" Soap breaks down fats, and the membrane around our cells is essentially made out of fats. So adding soap will burst the cells in your saliva and spill out their DNA.
At this point, the DNA is actually soluble in water: the charges along the backbone of the DNA interact with water molecules and keep it dissolved. We can counteract those changes by adding some table salt, which will help the DNA to come out of solution. Dispense a small amount of salt into each tube and tell participants to mix it in by inverting a couple of times.
Optional: There are all sorts of proteins stuck to the DNA at this point. Plus, the mixture also contains some enzymes that will degrade DNA. We can get rid of those proteins by adding some meat tenderizer. Meat tenderizer consists of bromelain or papain—these are proteases, that is, enzymes that break down protein. If your mouth hurts from eating too much raw pineapple, that's because the lining of your mouth is being digested by the bromelain in pineapple. Adding the meat tenderizer will result in more pure DNA that should also last longer. (This step is educational, but I've never seen much practical difference, so skip if you feel the demo is dragging on too long.)
We need some way to pull the DNA out from all the other components of the saliva. Luckily, since we've just made the DNA insoluble in water, it would rather be in rubbing alcohol than in the watery saliva. Use the squeeze bottle to gently dispense isopropanol into the tube until almost full. Translucent strands of tangled DNA, typically coated in tiny bubbles, should rise to the top with the isopropanol.
Optional: Hand each participant a toothpick. Tell them to try snag some DNA with the toothpick, then roll the string of DNA it up on the toothpick. Now they can walk around with their DNA on a stick. This used to be a valuable lab skill decades ago. Nowadays, we work with such tiny amounts of DNA that the DNA is barely visible. But we still use the same principles to extract DNA: detergents, salts, often alcohol extraction.
Make sure the participants dispose of their sampling tubes in the trash can with waterproof liner that you've set out for this purpose. Or bring caps for the tubes, in case anyone wants to take their DNA with them. Offer paper towels or wet wipes if people want to clean their hands.

Whenever you leave the demo station, make sure to dispose of your gloves, and disinfect your hands with wet wipes, or isopropanol and paper towels. It is a good idea to also regularly wipe down the table and disinfect the outside of all the containers to avoid cross-contamination. At the end of the day, the trash bag should be safe to dispose in household waste (you've already thoroughly disinfected most of the saliva using soap, salt, and alcohol). If you suspect the venue where you are doing this demo may be squeamish about a trash bag full of lab gloves and spit tubes, you may want to bring the trash bag back to your lab for disposal.

## Bring Your Cleanup Supplies {#bring-your-cleanup-supplies}

Think ahead—what would you do if someone drops whatever you’re bringing to an outside location? Or spills it all over themselves? If you are planning to do biology outside a lab, these are some of the supplies you may likely want to bring:



*   Gloves—including XS if working with kids
*   Roll(s) of paper towel
*   Wet wipes
*   Isopropanol (note that isopropanol can stain vinyl or wood floors—you may want to bring a second disinfectant such as a quaternary ammonium spray bottle as well)
*   Goggles and lab coats, depending on the splash hazard of the activity
*   Thin plastic painter’s tarp to cover floor and tables, if your host requires it.


## Education & Public Engagement Resources Developed by iGEM Teams {#education-&-public-engagement-resources-developed-by-igem-teams}

The yearly iGEM synthetic Biology competition has long had an “Education and Public Engagement” component. The William & Mary team created an Outreach Database containing 2700 outreach events and activities held by iGEM teams that won Gold medals.

Here are a few notable resources:



*   [2019 William & Mary Outreach Database](https://2019.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Software) and [Github link](http://github.com/jasonlin45/outreach_database)
*   William & Mary 2017 also created [Synthetic Biology Activities booklets](http://2017.igem.org/Team:William_and_Mary/Activites_Booklet) for Grades [K-5](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/9/91/T--William_and_Mary--k-5.pdf), [6-8](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/0/0e/T--William_and_Mary--6-8.pdf), and [9-12](http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/c/cb/T--William_and_Mary--9-122.pdf)
*   Aachen 2016 created a [book of experiments](http://2016.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b9/T--Aachen--Experimentesammlung_fuer_Lehrer_safety_external_wiki.pdf) that do not require equipment for teachers to more easily teach biology (in German).
