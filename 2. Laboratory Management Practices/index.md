# **2. Laboratory Management Practices** {#2-laboratory-management-practices}


## Organizational Structure and Safety Officer Roles {#organizational-structure-and-safety-officer-roles}

In community biology there is no one standard or “right” way to structure the organizing team. Structures can depend on your type of space—whether it’s a rented space, kitchen lab, space within a larger institution, or a mobile lab. Some labs have a hierarchical structure with a single director, while others have a flat management scheme where there are multiple directors. What seems to be common and good practice across organizations is that there is at least one point person who screens projects for safety (e.g., biological, physical, and chemical) and a committee of people to assist that point person in making decisions about safety and security. Often this committee is internal and allows for multiple people with different areas of expertise to assess and weigh-in on a proposed project. Some labs have several point people, where each is devoted to different safety aspects of the lab—for example, one person might vet chemical safety, while another vets biological safety. Typically, the safety officer(s) of the lab have experience working with chemical and/or biological agents in a research setting, but this is not always the case. 

One generally recommended practice is to recruit expert advisors outside of the organization who you can consult when the safety of a project is in question or is beyond the expertise of the internal safety point person or committee. These consultants can be safety officers at universities, safety committees at other community biology labs, or colleagues in biotech or university labs who might be an expert in a field related to a proposed project. Many biosafety professionals are willing to help provide advice, serve as resources, and volunteer as a member of a biosafety advisory committee. To find consultants, reach out to Biosafety Officers (BSOs) at your local universities or connect with biosafety professionals through the [American Biological Safety Association](http://www.absa.org) (ABSA) and [ABSA regional affiliates](https://absa.org/affiliates/). You can also ask biosafety questions on ABSA’s [Biosafety Discussion List](https://absa.org/email-groups/). 


## Negotiating a Lab in a Shared Space {#negotiating-a-lab-in-a-shared-space}

Often labs are within universities, makerspaces, or share a building with other businesses or organizations. If the community lab is in a shared space, it is a good idea to initiate and maintain frequent communication with other users of the shared space. Consider holding an open house or inviting neighbors into the space to share experiences and work progress. Tours and open events could be tied to a local Science Festival or event to get maximum publicity. Often these can defuse fears about community labs, make people feel welcome, and help neighbors understand the value of community labs. If the lab does suffer an incident, receives bad press, or is attacked by local officials or interest groups, it can be very valuable to have already built support within the larger community. 

In a shared space, it is also important to be mindful of common spaces. Lab coats or gloves should not be worn outside the lab. Perception that you are operating safely is important so it may be useful to clearly separate and bag trash that looks like it has come from the lab, even when putting it in the regular waste is permitted by local laws and biosafety rules. This will help prevent other users of the space from getting needlessly alarmed by seeing gloves or other lab waste in the regular bins.


## Process for Proposing Projects and Vetting {#process-for-proposing-projects-and-vetting}

We recommend having in-person conversations with lab members (or potential members) about project proposals as a first step in collecting information to address potential safety concerns. Instituting a system where members can formally submit a written project proposal is an important next step. Many labs use an online form to submit project ideas so they may be easily reviewed and approved (see examples of forms from [BioCurious](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScs3u07JuoxYM7v_GgL-LwZIDHw7SYcj6rmFF6RJNy4bCsgxQ/viewform), [Genspace](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/3/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU8xl_6n72gfdUlix6yW5oCHD-K4iUm7L4xboWMD83mUnJ-A/viewform), or [iGEM’s safety check](https://2019.igem.org/Safety/Final_Safety_Form)). 

In the project form, members are often asked to describe the techniques they will use, the chemicals and biological agents they will need, and the amount of time they expect the project to take. Some labs also inquire about the skill level of the person conducting the research to determine whether they might need additional knowledge- or skills-based training or to be matched with a mentor (see [Biomakespace’s project form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clan6TTXbopSvlndoP_YEOSCWrX13MRQbKDHSu_rJvU/view) as an example). It is a good idea to require long-term members to resubmit project proposal forms when their projects change. 

Community labs are founded on the belief that experience should not be a barrier to lab access. However, it is always a good idea to assess the experience level of potential members to provide the best possible support to ensure the safety of everyone working in the lab. Depending on skill level, restrictions may be established regarding working alone or operating particular types of equipment until proficiency is gained. Some labs require or encourage less experienced members to enroll in one of the skills building courses offered at the lab. Also, it is suggested to develop approaches for “On the spot” training for resources when members seem to lack proficiency. 

In addition to the project proposal form, some labs ask members to fill out a Risk Assessment Form that is reviewed by the safety team. The Risk Assessment Form helps members think through the potential hazards of their project and to plan mitigation strategies. In some countries, for example the UK, the regulations for any experiments with genetically modified organisms require written risk assessments to humans and to the environment for which “competent advice” (as described in the [UK Genetically Modified Organisms Contained Use Regulations 2014](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm)) is obtained before the experiment can start. Labs such as Biomakespace in the UK, therefore, also have a [form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vwdneyAZKEMSmvrNdn_cfzS-13smbV_MaK_0nHiNGbc/edit) that is specific for any GM work that members want to do.  

These written forms are good for recordkeeping, lab management, and are important for keeping detailed information of projects being performed in labs. They are also good tools for tracking projects in the long-term. For this reason, we also recommend members update their proposal documents quarterly or bi-annually as projects change and develop over time.  

Members may be incentivized to maintain and update their proposals because the information they provide can be helpful in connecting members with similar interests, assessing lab members’ equipment and reagent needs, deciding on new purchases, avoiding cross contamination, and preparing grant proposals. 


## Contracts and Member Agreements {#contracts-and-member-agreements}

We strongly recommend that all members be required to sign some form of legal contract to work in community labs. These membership agreements typically include all or some of the following: 



*   Access and key policies
*   Agreement to abide by safety rules
*   Code of conduct statements
*   Policies about damages caused by members or guests
*   Data policy
*   Description of fees and due dates
*   Different types of membership
*   Eligibility
*   Explanation of benefits—use of the lab and storage space, mentoring, discounts, etc.
*   Guest policy
*   Health risks to immune-compromised members
*   Intellectual property
*   Liability release
*   Lost or abandoned property
*   Membership terms
*   Safe space policy
*   Storage rules
*   Termination rules
*   Value statement (e.g., [DIY Biology Code of Ethics](https://diybio.org/codes/))

All of these items should be described clearly, in plain language, and with as much detail as possible. It is a good idea to have the agreement reviewed by a lawyer. Examples of member agreements are available from [Genspace](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaRV-CndEp2pvrnIgqg2bvxOGjwh0tYm/view?usp=sharing), [Biomakespace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ko5IVFkdotf9h1xgZsC5UP3K6OkaLQXnE5zEfNyy2cc/edit), and [BioCurious](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRVMkmcjlERmfNm41G6dfSDA8USKBMu-dzRGTKp_ifI/edit?usp=sharing). [Please upload your labs examples to provide more resources to the community.]


## Codes of Conduct  {#codes-of-conduct}

Some labs have codes of conduct that are either embedded in the member agreement or are separate documents. Codes of conduct set expectations of behavior in the lab and describe actions that will be taken if the code is violated. Examples are available from [BioCurious](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzPDj7v-AYvIZYqI0W8lQerolNGESq64-Br9OXr76u8/edit?usp=sharing) and [Biomakespace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lyi5n9oZt2umtece14ZADq9rba3DKx2FCjTSBFDBiDk/edit). Another example is the Code of Ethics drawn up by participants of the 2018 [Global BioSummit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swSbo_TidiaL1H-CK_mMW8e_G3cCk-MSw25W9EMdHzY/edit), further expanded upon in the [Community Ethics Document 1.0](https://www.biosummit.org/ethics) at the 2019 Global Biosummit.


## Access and Hours {#access-and-hours}

Many members of community labs are working in the facility in their spare time, often before or after work hours, or at unusual hours because of the time-consuming nature of lab experiments. With these considerations in mind, many labs allow 24 hour, 7 day a week access to the lab for members. In some labs, this type of open access is given with the caveat that there always needs to be a second person present for safety, that the work done after hours be an approved project that has been vetted, or that members working through the night are required to notify a safety officer. 

It is a good idea to require members to sign in and out of the space and/or have keys with Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) to allow labs to track members’ comings and goings (or at least entering) when staff are not on site. Some labs have camera surveillance of their space. Note that local laws may require posted notification and legal disclosures for any video surveillance in the facility.

If members are allowed to work in the lab after hours, and to work alone, there are steps that may be taken to help ensure their safety:



*   Assess the hazards of the lab area to identify existing or potential working alone hazards.
*   Take corrective measures to prevent and minimize hazards or potential incidents.
*   Provide easily accessible emergency equipment, emergency aid, and practical means of obtaining assistance based on the nature and degree of exposure to the hazard.
*   Ensure emergency aid is available and compatible with the member’s work. 
*   Train members on methods for identification, hazard reduction and prevention when working alone and setting clear action plans for encounters with people who do not belong in the space after hours.
*   Provide an effective form of communication between anyone working alone and the people capable of assisting the individual. Always encourage a buddy system, and ask the member to alert a fellow lab member, partner, or neighbor (even if that person is not in the space) about their whereabouts.
*   Post signage, emergency contact information, and develop a communication system for individuals working alone. These should include a list of phone numbers including the biosafety point person and first responders.
*   Require members to be reachable by cell phone or make a phone service available to members. 
*   Ensure that all incidents are reported, investigated, and documented. 


## Ordering and Receiving Materials {#ordering-and-receiving-materials}

Monitoring chemicals, reagents, and supplies that come into the laboratory is crucial for maintaining a safe lab. Community labs manage this in various ways. When it comes to chemicals and reagents, some labs require that the lab managers place all of the orders for members, while others allow members to place their own orders, provided that the items were pre-approved by the safety officer. For example, at BioCurious, every chemical must have an owner who is responsible for the chemical, and their name must be written on it, even if it is a commonly shared chemical. Owners are responsible for submitting any new chemical [Safety Data Sheets](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html) (SDS) forms to the safety officers. At Biomakespace, all chemicals were included in the project proposal and risk assessment, labelled with the project or user name, and added to the chemical inventory on arrival in the space. Some states in the U.S. require that inventories be electronically filed with the state.  

Most labs keep lists of all of the chemicals that come into the space and conduct regular inventories to update the list. This inventory is important, particularly for emergency responders, such as the fire department, to know what is in the space. There are some chemical inventory systems (e.g., [https://www.cheminventory.net/](https://www.cheminventory.net/)) that allow barcodes and labels to be printed and have free tiers up to a certain number of containers.  


## Donation of Supplies  {#donation-of-supplies}

**“**Donations” (or dumping) of unwanted reagents, supplies, or equipment can pose a serious health and safety hazard, put a strain on limited lab storage space, or impose significant costs for disposal. Most labs have rules prohibiting members from accepting donations of chemicals and supplies on behalf of the lab without pre-approval from the lab manager. This can help prevent potentially hazardous chemicals from entering the lab and prevent duplicates of equipment that could pile up. This also helps to keep inventories up to date, which is important for safety and accounting and ensures that any donation paperwork reconciles with what is actually on the shelves.  


```
BOX: Don't Let This Happen to Your Lab
Some real-world examples of unwanted "donations" with which community labs have had to contend include: 
A large jar of mercury
Containers of unknown reagents with illegible or missing labels
A 2kg can of a chemical that is prone to self-heating and bursting into flame when left open
An antique gas-powered autoclave weighing 300lbs
Equipment with odd discoloration from chemical stains or covered in orange chemical powder
Centrifuge rotors with hardened chemical deposits
Equipment dripping with sludge and goo
Freezers that stink like death
Several -80°C freezer boxes with undocumented storage strains and plasmids from a failed startup
Equipment with unclear provenance and prominent radioactivity or biohazard warning labels; heck for warning stickers, even those that are half peeled
100g sodium azide ("enough to poison the entire watershed if it had gone down the drain")
Canisters of human sperm, bull sperm, etc.
```



## Storage of Member Supplies {#storage-of-member-supplies}

Offering members storage space for project supplies can be helpful for the success of their projects. It is a good idea to specify which storage locations are considered “inside” or “outside” of the lab area and what is and is not allowed to be stored in these spaces. Community labs should avoid the inappropriate storage of hazardous chemicals, reagents, or equipment. As such, we recommend that labs specify prohibited chemicals and organisms from being stored in these locations. Materials should be kept in labeled, clear containers of uniform size to make it easier to screen things that are being stored.

Easily understood policies need to be established to prevent members from over encumbering freezer or refrigerator space. Many spaces limit members to a specific number of boxes or particular size or scope of storage bins and boxes. 

Storage space management policies should be outlined clearly, requiring labeling and cleanout dates. Frequent cleanouts of storage space should be communicated and performed on a regular schedule. These messages should be posted on doors, sent via email, and shared through personal communication. Membership agreements should also address reagents or materials that will be discarded or placed in a quarantine bin or box until disposal and detail how the owner will be contacted and how long the reagents will remain in the quarantine box (often nicknamed the “box of shame”). 

**Example Storage Policies**

**BioCurious: **“We really have designed the lab, architecturally, to be transparent. Walls are mostly absent, people can see through the space, almost all storage is required to be transparent, so items are easier to find and somewhat on display, rather than tucked in drawers or cabinets.”

**Offering to members:** Member bin. We offer members storage for a fee. To arrange this, email us. Storage needs to be clearly labeled with your first and last name.

## Youth Policies {#youth-policies}

For safety and insurance purposes, many community labs do not allow youth under 18 years of age into their space unless accompanied by an adult guardian. Check with your insurance provider to confirm their policy. 

Some community biology labs restrict youth under the age of 18 from working alone in the lab, but allow youth (mostly 14+ years old) to work or volunteer if supervised by an adult parent or mentor. Some labs restrict the number of youth that can be supervised by an adult mentor at one time. Local laws and regulations may also impose limits on how many minors can be in the space and/or require stricter building codes and background checks for staff.** **The NIH has [this policy](https://policymanual.nih.gov/3015#97DB16DB) for youth working in lab space. Those labs that allow youth to have their own membership, require that they work during regular operating hours, when staff is onsite. Most labs welcome youth to participate in lab trainings, courses, and workshops, as long as an adult is participating with them. Policies should also be outlined for any violation of the membership agreement policies.  

It is good practice to have a safeguarding or child protection policy (for example, see the [Biomakespace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdG2vAGiYsCpx3yk8nmttrL16lS8aExrS3nb3YaTHf8/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=103519764889495260290) policy or the [Omni Commons Safer Space policy](https://omnicommons.org/wiki/Safer_Space_Policy)) that outlines practices that minimize risks of harm from behaviors such as bullying, harassment or abuse, and a response policy. This is especially important if minors are not accompanied by adults. This policy may be linked to a general code of conduct, but we recommend designating a responsible person to keep up-to-date with best practices specifically for youth because they are more vulnerable to harm. 

In some countries there are regulations around activities and teaching undertaken with youth under 18 years of age which include requirements for vetting, criminal records checks, or other requirements. 

Note: Laws and insurance requirements will vary about working with minors depending on where your lab is located. You should check your local/national laws before starting programs with minors.


## Visitor and Guest Policies {#visitor-and-guest-policies}

If members are permitted to bring guests into the space, it’s important that membership contracts state who is liable for the guests and what access rights the guests have (e.g., non-lab areas only or lab access under direct supervision of the host). If member’s guests’ contact details will be used to add them to any mailing lists or follow-up with recruitment information, or if there is an expectation that frequent or repeat guests become members, it is useful to include this in a written policy or in the membership agreement so members are aware before they bring guests to the lab. We recommend creating a sign in and sign out procedure to keep track of guests who have been in the space (this is often necessary for fire safety reasons in any case).

We strongly recommend that anyone entering your space (visitors, volunteers, school groups, etc.) read and sign a liability release waiver. (For example, these are Genspace’s [general waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sT3YDZ5jdcrgOn7XwxxthZZrP_KinKDN81ORc_oisfs/edit) and [volunteer/intern waiver](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qywHdaipSDcV3X3Ed8-LrcGRWnRhyQcha_dXGsQXdHQ/edit?usp=sharing) and BioCurious’a [general wavier](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B78d3f_h4TZydmFSU1ZpQWFoS0U) and [family membership wavier and agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tJWKLfxyqQtMZL1Ku2zGDEam4yVGTmb5OSSyIDd0Mow/edit).) [Please add your examples here.]


## Insurance and Worker’s Compensation {#insurance-and-worker’s-compensation}

**Public liability, general insurance, or umbrella policies:** Given inherent risks in any lab, we recommend that labs acquire insurance to cover potential incidents that might cause injury to guests, members, volunteers, and employees. Without insurance, if someone has been injured, your organization and potentially you personally may be liable for the costs. These could easily bankrupt a community lab.  Note that the status of volunteers is ambiguous, but if they have a role description they are likely to be considered employees for insurance purposes. Check with your insurer.

**Contents or renters insurance:** We recommend that you insure your lab and its contents in the event of a fire, theft, or other unforeseen events. Many landlords require insurance. Please inquire. 

**Directors and officers insurance: **Most nonprofit organizations have this type of insurance to cover their directors for claims made against them for the management of the organisation. Seek advice about appropriate coverage from an insurance broker who has experience working with biotech companies or science centers. 

**Events and contractor insurance:** Specific events might require their own insurance or an insurance rider for use of facilities. We recommend reviewing insurance that your contractors and service providers hold. For example, if a service provider damages something in your lab while trying to repair it, who would be liable? Also create a policy on those who might use your space for their own purposes. For example, if an independent instructor uses your space to run their own workshops, do they have their own public liability insurance or is there an expectation that you are covering their activities under your own insurance? Parties that are open to the public and/or serve alcohol may also require special event permits from the city or police department.

**Other types of insurance:** Make sure to check local regulations for unusual insurance requirements! In the United Kingdom, and possibly other countries, labs with autoclaves are required to have special insurance due to legislation for pressure vessels (UK Pressure Systems Safety Regulations of 2000, which requires that an autoclave be inspected by an insurer-approved person every year.)  


## Working with Startups and Commercial Businesses {#working-with-startups-and-commercial-businesses}

Many community labs open their doors to start-up companies or individuals pursuing a business. Ensure that the company understands and is supportive of the mission and goals of the community lab and is held to the same standards as other members of the lab. These standards should include openness, transparency and inclusivity (within reason). Most community labs choose not to claim any ownership of the start-ups intellectual property (IP) and expect that the same openness is reciprocated.

Corporate members should be able to provide enough information about their projects to conduct a safety assessment. Because they are working in a community lab where open sharing is part of the culture, the company should be informed that it is responsible for protecting its IP. 

Corporate members sometimes ask lab management or other members to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This can expose the lab and its members to legal risks or responsibilities that may infringe upon the community lab’s culture of openness. In most cases, we recommend that community labs and their members do not sign NDAs and that this is written into your policies. If you do choose to sign one, we recommend seeking legal advice.

Aside from IP and disclosure considerations, startups and commercial projects will generally use the lab under the same terms as other members and should be required to sign membership agreements. 

Ensure that companies are clear about what they can expect from the staff (typically volunteers) of the lab. Our experience has been that some corporate members do not understand the nature of community labs and expect a professional service—this can be frustrating for both sides and it’s best to manage any misconceptions early on even if turning down income is difficult.


```
BOX: 
Some real-world examples of challenges encountered working with companies include:

Expecting volunteers to do their dishes, order reagents, spend lab funds on equipment the startup needs, make a financial investment in their company, perform regular equipment maintenance, review their startup pitch, provide market data, and answer many questions.
Expecting volunteers to coordinate their use of the lab, instead of joining lab communication channels to directly ask other members and lab users.
Making exceptions to safety or ethics policies for "just this one experiment." 
Filling every available space with large orders of consumables like pipette tips and not complying with storage guidelines.
Constantly trying to negotiate on membership prices and get discounts and reductions to unreasonable levels.
Getting many items delivered to the space and not dealing with them in a timely manner. Particularly unexpected deliveries of large equipment or reagents that need refrigeration and expecting that a volunteer will be around to deal with it.
Trying to get a lab to sign a blanket IP disclosure NDA for the entire lab and it's members and other companies projects, usually seen as an IP grab by a VC (see recommendation above to intentionally avoid signing NDAs).
Expecting that their contractors can come into the space as "guests" for several weeks at a time and being reluctant to pay for an additional membership because "they don't need their own access card."
```


Despite the challenges of working with companies, these are infrequent incidents and many community labs have excellent relationships with their startup members. Company memberships often contribute financially in ways that can be critical to community lab business models, and they are important community members in many other ways. They may be more available in the lab than individual members and willing to assist with lab management, taking deliveries, publicizing the space within the startup and investment community, helping pay for new facilities and servicing of equipment, writing the space into grants, and donating back. Be mindful and review your policies to maximize the mutual benefits of working with startups and commercial projects in a way that all parties feel good.
